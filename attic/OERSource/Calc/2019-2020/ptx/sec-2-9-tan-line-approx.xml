  <introduction permid="PXA">
    <p permid="HnI">
      Among all functions, linear functions are simplest.
      One of the powerful consequences of a function
      <m>y = f(x)</m> being differentiable at a point <m>(a,f(a))</m> is that
      up close
      the function <m>y = f(x)</m> is locally linear and looks like its tangent line at that point.
      In certain circumstances,
      this allows us to approximate the original function <m>f</m> with a simpler function <m>L</m> that is linear:
      this can be advantageous when we have limited information about <m>f</m> or when <m>f</m> is computationally or algebraically complicated.
      We will explore all of these situations in what follows.
    </p>

    <p permid="nuR">
      It is essential to recall that when <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x = a</m>,
      the value of <m>f'(a)</m> provides the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      If we know both a point on the line and the slope of the line we can find the equation of the tangent line and write the equation in point-slope form.<fn>
      Recall that a line with slope <m>m</m> that passes through
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> has equation <m>y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)</m>,
      and this is the <term>point-slope form</term> of the equation.

      The former is a constant that results from using the given fixed value of <m>a</m>,

    <title>The Local Linearization</title>
<!--    <idx><h>local linearization</h></idx>-->

    <p permid="LXB">
      A slight change in perspective and notation will enable us to be more precise in discussing how the tangent line approximates <m>f(x)</m> near <m>x = a</m>.
      By solving for <m>y</m>,
      we can write the equation for the tangent line as
      <me permid="Vrn">
        y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)
      </me>.
      This line is itself a function of <m>x</m>.
      Replacing the variable <m>y</m> with the expression <m>L(x)</m>, we have the following. 
      <assemblage><title>Local Linearization</title>

      <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m>. For this reason, <m>L(x)</m> is also called the

<li>
<p>
We start by computing <m>p'(t)</m>, and then evaluating <m>p(1)</m> and <m>p'(1)</m>. 
Since <m>p(t)=\ln(t)</m>, the derivative is <m>p'(t)=\frac1t</m>. Furthermore, we have 
<m>p(1)=\ln(1)=0</m> and <m>p'(1)=\frac11=1</m>.

<me>L(t)=p(1)+p'(1)(t-1)=0+1(t-1)=t-1</me>.

<li>
<p>
Since we can use the tangent line approximation for <m>p</m> at <m>(1,0)</m> to estimate

Thus we have <me>\ln(1.01)\approx0.01</me>.

</li>
<li>
<p>
Since we can use the tangent line approximation for <m>p</m> at <m>(1,0)</m> to estimate

Thus we have <me>\ln(1.3)\approx0.3</me>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Since <m>1.3</m> is farther away from the point of tangency <m>(t=1)</m> than <m>1.01</m> is, 
we expect the estimate to be better for <m>1.01</m>.

    <idx><h>local linearization</h><h>properties</h></idx>
      In <xref ref="act-1-8-1">Example</xref>, we saw that
      the local linearization <m>L</m> is a linear function that shares two important values with the function
      <m>f</m> that it is derived from.
      In particular,

      <ul permid="clS">
        <li permid="NcU">
          because <m>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</m>,
          it follows that <m>L(a) = f(a)</m>; and
        </li>

        <li permid="tkd">
          because <m>L</m> is a linear function,
          its derivative is its slope.
          Hence, <m>L'(x) = f'(a)</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
          and specifically <m>L'(a) = f'(a)</m>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Therefore, we see that <m>L</m> is a linear function that has both the same value and the same slope as the function <m>f</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Etc">
      Thus, if we know the linear approximation <m>y = L(x)</m> for a function <m>f</m>,
      we know the original function's value and its slope at the point of tangency.
      What remains unknown, however,
      is the shape of the function <m>f</m> at the point of tangency.
      There are essentially four possibilities,
      as shown below in <xref ref="F-1-8-Options">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-8-Options" permid="cVM">
      <caption>Four possible graphs for a nonlinear differentiable function (in blue) and how it can be situated relative to its tangent line (in green) at a point.
      Note that these cases correspond to a tangent line with positive slope. There are four similar possibilities when the slope of the tangent line 
      is negative or zero.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/1_8_Options" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="kAl">
      These possible shapes result from the fact that there are three options for the value of the second derivative:
      either <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m>,
      <m>f''(a) = 0</m>, or <m>f''(a) \gt 0</m>.

      <ul permid="Itb">
        <li permid="Zrm">
          If <m>f''(a) \gt 0</m>,
          then we know the graph of <m>f</m> is concave up,
          and we see the first possibility on the left,
          where the tangent line lies entirely below the curve.
        </li>

        <li permid="Fyv">
          If <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m>,
          then <m>f</m> is concave down and the tangent line lies above the curve,
          as shown in the second image.
        </li>

        <li permid="lFE">
          If <m>f''(a) = 0</m> and <m>f''</m> changes sign at <m>x = a</m>,
          the concavity of the graph will change,
          and we will see either the third or fourth image.<fn>
          It is possible that
          <m>f''(a) = 0</m> but <m>f''</m> does not change sign at <m>x = a</m>,
          in which case the graph will look like one of the first two options.
          </fn>
        </li>

        <li permid="RMN">
          A fifth option (which is not very interesting)
          can occur if the function <m>f</m> itself is linear,
          so that <m>f''(x)=0</m> and <m>f(x) = L(x)</m> for all values of <m>x</m>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p permid="QHu">
      The plots in <xref ref="F-1-8-Options">Figure</xref>
      highlight yet another important thing that we can learn from the concavity of the graph near the point of tangency:
      whether the tangent line lies above or below the curve itself.
      This is key because it tells us whether or not the tangent line approximation's values will be too large or too small in comparison to the true value of <m>f</m>.
      For instance,
      in the leftmost plot in <xref ref="F-1-8-Options">Figure</xref> where <m>f''(a) > 0</m>,
      we know that <m>L(x) \le f(x)</m> for all values of <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>
      because the tangent line falls below the curve.

      The idea that a differentiable function looks linear and can be well-approximated by a linear function is an important one that is widely applied in calculus.
      For example,
      it is possible to develop an effective algorithm to estimate the zeroes of a function
      by approximating the function with its local linearization.
      Local linearity also helps us to make further sense of certain challenging limits.
      For instance, the limit
      <me permid="tTX">
        \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
      </me>
      is indeterminate,
      because both its numerator and denominator tend to 0.
      While there is no algebra that we can do to simplify <m>\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m>,
      it is straightforward to show that the linearization of
      <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> at the point <m>(0,0)</m> is given by <m>L(x) = x</m>.
      Hence <m>\sin(x)\approx x</m> for values of <m>x</m> near 0,
      and therefore
      <me permid="abg">
        \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \approx \frac{x}{x} = 1
      </me>
      near <m>x=0</m>. This makes plausible the fact that
      <me permid="Gip">
        \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1

            The principle of local linearity tells us that if we zoom in on a point where a function <m>y = f(x)</m> is differentiable,
            the function will be indistinguishable from its tangent line.
            That is,
            a differentiable function looks linear when viewed up close.
            We rename the tangent line to be the function
            <m>y = L(x)</m>, where <m>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</m>.
            Thus,

            In other words,
            the linear approximation tells us the height and slope of the original function.
            If in addition we know the value of <m>f''(a)</m>,
            we then know whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of
