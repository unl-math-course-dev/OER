          In a setting where a situation is described for which optimal parameters are sought,
          how do we develop a function that models the situation and then use calculus to find the desired maximum or minimum?
        </p>

  <introduction permid="yiR">
    <p permid="dkH">
      Near the conclusion of <xref ref="sec-3-3-optimization">Section</xref>,
      we considered two optimization problems in which determining the function to be optimized was part of the problem.
      <xref ref="Ex-3-3-1">Example</xref> sought to maximize the total area enclosed by the combination of 
      an equilateral triangle and a square built from a single piece of wire (cut in two).
      <xref ref="act-3-3-3">Example</xref> subsequently investigated how the volume of 
      a box constructed by removing squares from the corners of a piece of cardboard 
      is dependent on the size of the squares removed.
    </p>

    <p permid="JrQ">
      Neither of these problems explicitly provided a function to optimize.
      Instead, we first tried to understand the problem by
      drawing a figure and introducing variables,
      and then sought to develop a formula for a function that modeled the quantity
      to be optimized.
      Upon establishing a function, we chose an appropriate domain and then 
      were finally ready to apply the ideas of calculus to determine the absolute minimum or maximum.

      In this section
      the primary emphasis is on the reader solving problems.
      Initially, some substantial guidance is provided,
      but the problems progress to require greater independence as we move along.

    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
</answer>
<solution>
  <p>
  <ol label="a">
    <li>
    <p>
    Since the problem says <m>y</m> is the length of the <em>longer</em> side, we assume
    <m>x\le y</m> and that the square end is smallest. However, we recognize that this 
    may not end up being the case, and if necessary are prepared to rework the problem 
    with the square end as the largest side.
    <figure>
      <caption>A rectangular parcel with smallest end a square.</caption>
      <image width="47%" source="images/3_3_labeledbox.jpg" />
    </figure>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    We are asked to maximize the volume of the box. Since the box has a square end with 
    side length <m>x</m> inches and is <m>y</m> inches long, the volume formula is 
    <me>V=x^2y</me>, measured in cubic inches.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    We are working under the assumption that the square end is the smallest end, which 
    means the perimeter of the square face will be the girth and the other side will 
    be the length. This yields the relation <me>4x+y=108</me>. We note again that we have 
    the assumed constraint <m>x\le y</m>. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Since <m>4x+y=108</m>, we can say that <m>y=108-4x</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Since <m>V=x^2y</m> and <m>y=108-4x</m>, an alternate expression for the parcel's 
    volume is <me>V(x)=x^2(108-4x)=108x^2-4x^3</me>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    We know that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> must both be positive, so we have <m>0\lt x,y</m>. 
    Additionally, because the girth is given by <m>4x</m> rather than by <m>2x+2y</m> 
    (the perimeter of the other sides), we can say that <m>x\le y</m>.
    Finally, since <m>4x+y=108</m> and <m>x\le y</m>, it must be the case that 
    <m>5x\le4x+y=108</m>, so <m>x\le 108/5=21.6</m>. Likewise, since <m>x</m> is positive, we must 
    have <m>y\lt 108</m>. 
    In sum, we have the intervals: <me>0\lt x\le21.6 \text{ and }x\le y\lt108</me>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    We now need to maximize the function <m>V(x)=108x^2-4x^3</m> on the interval <m>(0,21.6]</m>. 
    We begin by differentiating <m>V</m>, finding <me>V'(x)=216x-12x^2=12x(18-x)</me>.
    As <m>V'(x)</m> is a polynomial, it is defined everywhere; to find the critical numbers 
    of <m>V</m>, then, we need only solve the equation <m>V'(x)=0</m>. 
    Doing so yields the critical numbers <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=18</m>. On the interval 
    <m>0\lt x\le21.6</m>, the only critical number is <m>18</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Testing to check that this is a maximum, the first derivative test says <m>V'(x)\gt0</m>
    for <m>0\lt x\lt 18</m> and <m>V'(x)\lt0</m> for <m>18\lt x</m>. Thus <m>V(18)</m> is
    a relative maximum and, on the interval <m>(0,21.6]</m> (or more generally, the 
    interval <m>(0,\infty)</m>), an absolute maximum. 
    Further supporting this conclusion is the second derivative test, where <m>V''(x)=216-24x</m> 
    is zero only when <m>x=9</m>, and <m>V''(18)\lt0</m>, showing that <m>V</m> is concave 
    down on (at least) the interval <m>(9,21.6)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have firmly established that the maximum volume occurs when <m>x=18</m>. This coincides 
    with the length <m>y=108-4(18)=36</m> and the volume <m>V=(18)^2(36)=11,664</m>. Therefore the maximum volume 
    of a parcel with a square end (provided that end is the smallest end of the box<fn>
    It turns out that when we assume the square end is the larger end, we end up with 
    the dimensions <m>24\times24\times18</m> and a volume of <m>10,368\text{ in}^3</m>, 
    so our process did indeed find the maximum volume of a parcel with a square end.</fn>) subject 
    to the dimension constraints of the USPS is <m>11,664</m> cubic inches. This volume 
    is achieved when the package is <m>18</m> inches by <m>18</m> inches by <m>36</m> inches.

    <p permid="VGi">
      Many of the steps in <xref ref="PA-3-4">Example</xref>
      are ones that we will execute in any applied optimization problem.
      We briefly summarize those steps here to provide an overview of our approach in subsequent questions:

              <em>Draw a picture and introduce variables.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables.
              Drawing a picture with these variables labeled is a particularly helpful way to accomplish this;
              in some cases, drawing several pictures might be useful.
              A nice example of this can be seen at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/99">http://gvsu.edu/s/99</url>,
              where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.

            </p>
            <p>
              Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced:
              one equation will represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought;
              there may be additional equations showing how multiple variables in the problem are interrelated.

              <em>Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              It may be necessary to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula 
              using the secondary equations that were found in the previous step.
              For example, in <xref ref="PA-3-4">Example</xref>
              we initially found that <m>V = x^2 y</m>;
              the additional relationship that <m>4x + y = 108</m>
              allowed us to substitute <m>108-4x</m> for <m>y</m> in the volume equation, thus
              expressing the volume as a function of the single variable <m>x</m>.

              <em>Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on.
              Thinking back to the picture that describes the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.

            </p>
            <p>
              This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first.
              Then depending on the domain,
              we either construct a first derivative sign chart
              (for an open or unbounded interval)
              or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers
              (for a closed, bounded interval).

              <em>Finally, we make certain we have answered the question that was posed.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity,
              or do we need the values of the variables that produce the maximum?
              In other words, 
              finding the maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that yield that volume.

    The remaining examples involve a variety of quantities to be optimized.

            </fn> so we only need to consider critical numbers at 
            which the derivative is zero.

            <m>r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.123</m> is the only critical number of <m>C</m>.
            At this point
            we can use either the first or second derivative test to justify that <m>C</m> 
            has an absolute minimum at <m>r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} }</m>.
            We choose to use the second derivative test;
            note that <m>C''(r) = 0.108 \pi + 0.96 \frac{1}{r^3}</m>,
            which is always positive for <m>r \gt 0</m>.
            Thus <m>C</m> is always concave up on the relevant domain (<m>r \gt 0</m>),
            and consequently <m>r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.123</m> 
            is where the absolute minimum of <m>C</m> occurs.
            In addition, we note that since <m>h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}</m>,
            the corresponding <m>h</m> value is <m>h \approx 4.041</m>,
            and the overall minimum value is <m>C\left(\sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} }\right) \approx 0.641</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
          Thus a can with radius approximately <m>1.123</m> inches and height approximately 
          <m>4.041</m> inches will be cheapest among all cans with a volume of <m>16</m>

  <solution permid="sgT">
    <p permid="kCu">
      We begin by letting <m>x</m> be the distance from <m>Z</m> to <m>Q</m>.
      Since it is <m>3</m> km from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>,
      the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>Z</m> is <m>3-x</m> km.
      Furthermore, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that
      the distance from <m>Z</m> to the cabin is <m>\sqrt{4+x^2}</m> km.
    </p>

    <p permid="QJD">
      Next we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of <m>x</m>.
      Because distance equals rate times time,
      it follows that time is distance divided by rate.
      The hiker travels along the road for <m>3-x</m> km at a pace of <m>8</m> km/hr,
      thus her time on the road is
      <me permid="Gky">
        T_r = \frac{3-x}{8} \text{ hr}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="wQM">
      Once she enters the woods,
      her pace drops to <m>3</m> km/hr and she continues for <m>\sqrt{4+x^2}</m> km 
      before reaching the cabin.
      She spends a total of 
      <me permid="mrH">
        T_w = \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}
      </me>
      hours hiking in the woods.

    <p permid="cXV">
      Altogether, the time it takes the hiker to reach the cabin is given by the function

      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Jfe">
      Because the only values of <m>x</m> that make sense to use are <m>0 \le x \le 3</m>
      (since walking away from or past <m>Q</m> before turning to the cabin both add unnecessary time to the trip),
<!--      (using either negative values or values greater than <m>3</m> add unnecessary time to the trip),-->
      we use this domain for <m>T</m> and now seek the absolute minimum of <m>T</m> on <m>[0,3]</m>.
      We find that
      <me permid="yFZ">
        T'(x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(4+x^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} (2x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pmn">
      Note that since <m>4+x^2\ge2</m> for every value of <m>x</m>, <m>T'</m> is defined everywhere. 
      Setting <m>T'(x) = 0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>,
      we have <m>\frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}} = \frac{1}{8}</m>,
      so <m>8x = 3\sqrt{4+x^2}</m>.
      Squaring both sides yields <me>64x^2 = 9(4+x^2) = 36 + 9x^2</me>.
      Hence <m>55x^2 = 36</m>,
      so <m>x = \sqrt{\frac{36}{55}} \approx 0.809</m>.
      (We don't consider the critical number
      <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}</m> because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of <m>T</m>.)
    </p>

    <p permid="Vtw">
      Finally, we evaluate <m>T</m> at the only critical number in the interval and at the interval's endpoints.
      Doing so, we find <m>T(0) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{3} \approx 1.0417</m>,
      <m>T(3) = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{3} \approx 1.202</m>,
      and <m>T\left(\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}\right) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{55}}{12} \approx 0.993</m>.
      Thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is about <m>0.993</m> hours,
      which is attained by hiking about <m>2.2</m> km from <m>P</m> towards <m>Q</m> and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.

  </answer>
  <solution permid="Fff">
    <p permid="xAG">
      Once we choose the angle <m>\theta</m>,
      the two right triangles in the trapezoid are determined
      and each has a horizontal leg of length
      <m>\cos(\theta)</m> and a vertical leg of length <m>\sin(\theta)</m>.
      Thus the sum of the areas of the two triangles is <m>\cos(\theta) \sin(\theta)</m>,
      the area of the rectangle between them is <m>2\sin(\theta)</m>, 
      and the total area of the trapezoidal cross-section is <me>A(\theta) = \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) + 2 \sin(\theta)</me>.
      Because the length of the trough is constant,
      the trough's volume will be maximized by maximizing cross-sectional area.
      Note, too, that the domain for <m>\theta</m> is <m>0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="dHP">
      Differentiating the area function, we find that
      <me permid="GUs">
        A'(\theta) =  -\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="JOY">
      Using the identity <m>\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)</m>,
      it follows that
      <md permid="nbB">
        <mrow>A'(\theta) =\mathstrut\amp \cos^2(\theta) - 1 + \cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta)</mrow>

      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pWh">
      This most recent equation is quadratic in <m>\cos(\theta)</m>,
      so we can solve the equation
      <m>A'(\theta) = 0</m> by letting <m>u=\cos(\theta)</m> and 
      first solving <m>2u^2 + 2u - 1 = 0</m>.<fn>
      Note that since <m>0\le\theta\le\frac{\pi}2</m>, we have <m>0\le u\le1</m>.</fn> 
      Doing so yields
      <me permid="TiK">
        u = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.366, -1.366

      so only <m>u = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}</m> might be a value of the cosine function from an angle that lies in the interval <m>[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]</m>.
      To find the corresponding critical number <m>\theta</m>,
      we solve <m>\cos(\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}</m>,
      which implies <m>\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \approx 1.196</m> radians,
      or <m>\theta \approx 68.529^\circ</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Wdq">
      Finally, to confirm that <m>A</m> has an absolute maximum at <m>\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)</m>,
      we evaluate <m>A</m> at this value and at the interval endpoints
      to find that <m>A(0) = 0</m>,
      <m>A(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 2</m>,
      and <m>A(1.196) \approx 2.202</m> ft<m>^2</m>,
      which is the absolute maximum possible cross-sectional area.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Therefore the volume of the trough is maximized (at around <m>52.844</m> cubic feet) 
    when the sides are folded at an angle of approximately <m>1.196</m> radians.

      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution permid="cEN">
      <p permid="ZKh">
        Let <m>x</m> be the length of one side of the square bottom and <m>h</m> the height of one of the sides.
        We first note that the volume, <m>V</m>,
        of the box is <m>V = x^2 h</m>,
        and the surface area of the box is <m>S = 2x^2 +  4xh</m>,
        since there are two square sides
        (bottom and top)
        of area <m>x^2</m> and four identical sides of area <m>xh</m>.
        Since the material for the top and bottom costs <dollar />3.00 per square foot and the material for the sides costs <dollar />1.50 per square foot,
        it follows that the total cost of a box with surface area <m>S</m> is
        <me permid="doH">
          C = 1.50 (2x^2) +  3.00 (4xh) = 3x^2 + 12xh
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p permid="FRq">
        We are interested in building box of largest volume for which we spend <dollar />15.
        This cost constraint implies that
        <me permid="JvQ">
          15 = 3x^2 + 12xh
        </me>,
        which allows us to express <m>h</m> as a function of <m>x</m> by solving for <m>h</m>.
        Doing so, we see that <m>12xh = 15 - 3x^2</m>, so
        <me permid="pCZ">
          h = \frac{15-3x^2}{12x}
        </me>.
        Using this relationship, we are now able to express the volume,
        <m>V</m>,
        of the box as a function of the single variable <m>x</m>.
        Subsituting the expression for <m>h</m>, we have
        <me permid="VKi">
          V = x^2 h = x^2 \frac{15-3x^2}{12x} = \frac{1}{12}x(15 - 3x^2) = \frac{15}{12}x - \frac{1}{4}x^3
        </me>.
        Note particularly that in order to have a box,
        we require that both <m>x \gt 0</m> and <m>h \gt 0</m>.
        The latter condition along with the fact that
        <m>h = \frac{15-3x^2}{12x}</m> shows that we need <m>15 - 3x^2 \gt 0</m>,
        and thus <m>x^2 \lt 5</m>, so <m>x \lt \sqrt{5}</m>.
        Hence we are considering <m>V(x)</m> on the domain <m>0 \lt x \lt \sqrt{5}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="lYz">
        It is apparent that the box vanishes
        (and its volume tends to zero)
        as either <m>x \to 0^+</m> or <m>x \to \sqrt{5}^-</m>,
        and thus the absolute maximum volume must appear between these values at a critical number.
        Differentiating <m>V</m>,
        we find that <m>V'(x) = \frac{15}{12} - \frac{3}{4}x^2</m>.
        Solving <m>V'(x) = 0</m> to find all critical numbers of <m>V</m> in the domain,
        we see that <m>x^2 = \frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{3}</m>,
        and thus <m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}</m>,
        so only <m>x = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}</m> is a critical number that lies in <m>0 \lt x \lt \sqrt{5}</m>.
        Noting that the absolute minimum volume <m>V = 0</m> occurs at each endpoint,
        it must be the case that the absolute maximum volume is <m>V\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) = \frac{15}{12}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) - \frac{1}{4}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right)^3 \approx 1.07583</m> cubic feet.

        Since <m>A</m> has two variables,
        we can't yet directly apply calculus techniques to it.
        We use the information about the amount of fencing to relate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in order to write <m>A</m> in terms of just one variable.

      <p permid="eua">
        In the case of the fencing option on the left in the figure,

        We assume that all of the <m>7500</m> feet of fencing will be used,
        so <m>2x+5y=7500</m>.
        Solving for <m>x</m>, <m>x = 3750 - 2.5y</m>.
        Substituting this expression for <m>x</m> into the area formula allows us to write <m>A</m> in terms of <m>y</m> alone:

        To enclose any area,
        we of course must have <m>y \gt 0</m> and <m>x \gt 0</m>,

        it follows that we need to have
        <m>2.5y \lt 3750</m> so <m>y \lt 1500</m>.
        To find the maximum value of <m>A</m> on this domain,
        we find the critical numbers of <m>A</m>.
        Since <m>A'(y) = 3750 - 5y</m>,
        we see that <m>A'(y) = 0</m> when and only when <m>y = 750</m>.

        Given that we want to minimize <m>L</m> on this closed interval,
        it remains to find any critical numbers of <m>L</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="jdT">
        We note by the chain rule that
        <me permid="umS">
          L'(x) = \frac{2x}{2(x^2+3600)^{1/2}} + \frac{-2(100-x)}{2((100-x)^2 + 6400)^{1/2}}
        </me>
        We use technology to solve the equation
        <m>L'(x) = 0</m> and find that it has a single solution in the interval <m>0 \le x \le 100</m>:
        <m>x \approx 42.85714</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="Plc">
        To find the absolute minimum of <m>L</m> on the relevant domain,
        we evaluate <m>L</m> at the endpoints and the only critical number.
        Doing so, we fine <m>L(0) \approx 188.062</m>,
        <m>L(100) \approx 196.619</m>,
        and <m>L(42.85714) \approx 172.047</m>.
        Hence the least amount of cable we can use is approximately <m>172.047</m> feet and is accomplished by anchoring the cable about
        <m>42.85714</m> feet from the first tower.

  <title>Minimizing construction costs</title>
    <statement>
      <p permid="xhy">
        A company is designing propane tanks that are cylindrical with hemispherical ends.
        Assume that the company wants tanks that will hold 1000 cubic feet of gas,
        and that the ends are more expensive to make,
        costing <dollar />5 per square foot,
        while the cylindrical barrel between the ends costs <dollar />2 per square foot.
        Use calculus to determine the minimum cost to construct such a tank.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer permid="tCY">
      <p permid="YEO">
        The minimum cost is <dollar />1165.70.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution permid="NvP">
      <p permid="vsl">
        We let the length of the cylindrical part of the tank be <m>h</m> with the radius of the cylinder given by <m>r</m>.
        It follows that the radius of the hemispherical ends of the tank is also <m>r</m>.
        We first identify formulas for both the volume and surface area of the tank by looking at the cylindrical and hemispherical pieces.
      </p>

      <p permid="bzu">
        The cylindrical part of the tank has volume <m>V_c = \pi r^2 h</m>,
        and the surface area of its sides is <m>A_c = 2\pi r h</m>
        (which is the circumference of the cylinder's base times the cylinder's height -- think about how a cylinder unfurls to form a rectangle).
        The two hemispherical ends together constitute a full sphere,
        and the volume of a sphere is <m>V_s = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m>,
        while the surface area of a sphere is <m>A_s = 4 \pi r^2</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="HGD">
        The overall volume of the tank is therefore
        <me permid="aub">
          V = V_c + V_s = \pi r^2 h + \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
        </me>,
        and its total surface area is
        <me permid="GBk">
          A = A_c + A_s = 2\pi r h + 4 \pi r^2
        </me>.
        Moreover, taking into account the different costs of material for the cylindrical sides and hemispherical ends,
        we find that the total cost of the tank is
        <me permid="mIt">
          C = 2(2\pi r h) + 5(4 \pi r^2) = 4 \pi r h + 20 \pi r^2
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p permid="nNM">
        Our goal is to minimize the total cost of the tank given that we want it to hold 1000 cubic meters of volume.
        From this constraint,
        we have the equation <m>1000 = \pi r^2 h + \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m>,
        which we can solve for <m>h</m> to get <m>\pi r^2 h = 1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m>, so
        <me permid="SPC">
          h = \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2}
        </me>.
        This allows us to now write cost as a function of the single variable <m>r</m> by substituting the expression for <m>h</m> into the earlier formula we found for cost.
        In particular,
        <me permid="yWL">
          C(r) = 4 \pi r \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2} + 20 \pi r^2 = 4 \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{r} + 20\pi r^2
        </me>
        Simplifying further, we have found that
        <me permid="fdU">
          C(r) = \frac{4000}{r} - \frac{16}{3}\pi r^2 + 20 \pi r^2 = \frac{4000}{r} + \frac{44}{3}r^2
        </me>.
        Based on the physical constraints of the problem,
        we obviously will only consider values of <m>r \gt 0</m> and <m>h \gt 0</m>.
        Since <m>h = \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2}</m>,
        we must have
        <me permid="Lld">
          \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \lt 1000
        </me>
        so <m>r^3 \lt \frac{3}{4} \cdot 1000 = 750</m>,
        and thus <m>r \lt \sqrt[3]{750} \approx 9.086</m>.
        We now work to minimize <m>C(r)</m> on the interval <m>0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="TUV">
        Taking the derivative of <m>C</m>,
        we find that <m>C'(r) = -\frac{4000}{r^2} + \frac{88}{3}r</m>.
        Setting <m>C'(r) = 0</m>, it follows that
        <me permid="rsm">
          \frac{4000}{r^2} = \frac{88}{3}r
        </me>
        and thus
        <me permid="Xzv">
          4000 \cdot \frac{3}{88} = r^3
        </me>.
        Therefore, <m>r^3 = \frac{1500}{11}</m>,
        so <m>r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}} \approx 5.147</m> is the only critical number of <m>C</m>;
        observe that it lies within the interval <m>0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="Ace">
        If we plot the derivative function, <m>y = C'(r)</m>,
        on the interval <m>0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}</m>,
        we see that for <m>0 \lt r \lt 5.147</m>,
        <m>C'(r) \lt 0</m>,
        and for <m>5.147 \lt r \lt 9.086</m>, <m>C'(r) \gt 0</m>,
        which shows that <m>C</m> is decreasing before the critical number and increasing after the critical number,
        and hence <m>C</m> has a global minimum of <m>C(\sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}}) \approx 1165.70</m>,
        so <dollar />1165.70 is the minimum cost to build the desired tank under the given constraints.
