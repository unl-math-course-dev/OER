      Studying the units of the integrand and variable of integration helps us understand the meaning of a definite integral.
      For instance,
      if <m>v(t)</m> is the velocity of an object moving along an axis,
      measured in feet per second,
      and <m>t</m> measures time in seconds,
      then both the definite integral and its Riemann sum approximation,

        \int_a^b v(t) \, dt \approx \sum_{i=1}^n v(t_i) \Delta t

      <me permid="RGW">
        \text{(feet/sec)} \cdot \text{(sec)} = \text{feet}

      Thus, <m>\int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m> measures the total change in position

      The <em>mass</em>
      <idx><h>mass</h></idx>
      of an object,
      typically measured in metric units such as grams or kilograms,
      is a measure of the amount of material in the object.
      The <em>density</em> of an object measures the distribution of mass per unit volume.
      For instance,
      if a brick has mass 3 kg and volume 0.002 m<m>^3</m>,
      then the density of the brick is
      <me permid="xOf">
        \frac{3 \mbox{kg} }{0.002 \mbox{m} ^3} = 1500 \frac{\mbox{kg} }{\mbox{m} ^3}
      </me>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="BOe">
      As another example, the mass density of water is 1000 kg/m<m>^3</m>.
      Each of these relationships demonstrate the following general principle.
    </p>
    
    <assemblage permid="eqN">
      <title> Density Formula </title>
      <p permid="hVn">
        For an object of constant density <m>d</m>,
        with mass <m>m</m> and volume <m>V</m>,
        <me permid="dVo">
          d = \frac{m}{V}, \ \text{or}  \ m = d \cdot V
        </me>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    
    <p permid="Ocw">
      But what happens when the density is not constant?
    </p>
    
    <p permid="ujF">
      The formula <m>m = d \cdot V</m> is reminiscent of two other equations that we have used 
      in our work: for a body moving in a fixed direction,
      distance = rate <m>\cdot</m> time, and,
      for a rectangle, its area is given by <m>A = l \cdot w</m>.
      These formulas hold when the principal quantities involved,
      such as the rate the body moves and the height of the rectangle,
      are <em>constant</em>.
      When these quantities are not constant,
      we have turned to the definite integral for assistance.
      By working with small slices on which the quantity of interest
      (such as velocity)
      is approximately constant,
      we can use a definite integral to add up the values on the pieces.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="aqO">
      For example,
      if we have a nonnegative velocity function that is not constant,
      over a short time interval
      <m>\Delta t</m>, we know that the distance traveled is approximately <m>v(t) \Delta t</m>
      since <m>v(t)</m> is almost constant on a small interval.
      Similarly, if we are thinking about the area under a nonnegative function <m>f</m> whose value is changing,
      on a short interval <m>\Delta x</m>, the area under the curve is approximately the area of the rectangle whose height is <m>f(x)</m> and whose width is
      <m>\Delta x</m>: <m>f(x) \Delta x</m>.
      Both of these principles are represented visually in <xref ref="F-6-3-VelArea">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    
    <figure xml:id="F-6-3-VelArea" permid="roZ">
      <caption>At left, estimating a small amount of distance traveled, <m>v(t) \Delta t</m>, and at right, a small amount of area under the curve, <m>f(x) \Delta x</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/6_3_VelArea" />
    </figure>
    
    <p permid="GxX">
      In a similar way,
      if the density of some object is not constant, we can use a
      definite integral to compute the overall mass of the object.
      We will focus on problems where the density varies in only one dimension,
      say along a single axis.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <p permid="mFg">
        Let's consider a thin bar of length <m>b</m> whose left end is at the origin,
        where <m>x = 0</m>,
        and assume that the bar has constant cross-sectional area of 1 cm<m>^2</m>.
        We let <m>\rho(x)</m> represent the mass density function of the bar,
        measured in grams per cubic centimeter.
        That is, given a location <m>x</m>,
        <m>\rho(x)</m> tells us approximately how much mass will be found in a one-centimeter wide slice of the bar at <m>x</m>.
      </p>
      
      <figure xml:id="F-6-3-Bar" permid="Xwi">
        <caption>A thin bar of constant cross-sectional area 1 cm<m>^2</m> with density function <m>\rho(x)</m> g/cm<m>^3</m>.</caption>
        <image width="100%" source="images/6_3_Bar" />
      </figure>
      
      <p permid="SMp">
        The volume of a thin slice of the bar of width <m>\Delta x</m>,
        as pictured in <xref ref="F-6-3-Bar">Figure</xref>,
        is the cross-sectional area times <m>\Delta x</m>.
        Since the cross-sections each have constant area 1 cm<m>^2</m>,
        it follows that the volume of the slice is <m>1 \Delta x</m> cm<m>^3</m>.
        And because mass is the product of density and volume,
        we see that the mass of this slice is approximately
        <me permid="Kcx">
          \text{mass} _{\text{slice} } \approx \rho(x) \ \frac{\mbox{g} }{\mbox{cm} ^3} \cdot 1 \Delta x \ \mbox{cm} ^3 = \rho(x) \cdot \Delta x \ \mbox{g}
        </me>.
      </p>
      
      <p permid="yTy">
        Therefore, the total mass of the bar is measured by the corresponding Riemann sum 
        (and the integral that it approximates)
        <me permid="qjG">
          \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(x_i) \Delta x \approx \int_0^b \rho(x) \, dx=\text{mass}_{\text{total}}
        </me>. 
        (As usual, the Riemann sum is an approximation,
        while the integral will be the exact mass.)
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <p permid="faH">
      For objects whose cross-sectional area is constant and whose mass is distributed relative to horizontal 
      location, <m>x</m>,
      it makes sense to think of the density function <m>\rho(x)</m> with units

    <title> Radial Density </title>
    
    <p>
      In some 2D or 3D objects, density depends on distance from a center point.
      In this case, we will apply the principle from the previous section (that mass is the integral of density),
      but must make a slight adjustment to account for the fact that layers of the same thickness will have different volumes depending on their distance from the center.
      
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <p>
        
        Consider a 1 meter long metal pipe covered with a layer of insulation. 
        
        <image width="50%" source="images/6_4_Ex4_Figure"/>
        
        How would we find the total mass of the pipe? 
        We would need to add up the masses of the metal and the insulation, and these masses can be found by taking density times volume: 
        <me>\text{mass}_{\text{layer}}=\rho_{\text{layer}}V_{\text{layer}}</me>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        But note that the density of the layer depends on its distance from the center: close to the center of the pipe,
        the hollow core of the pipe has 0 density, at a radius of <m>r_1</m> the metal pipe has a high density,
        and at a radius of <m>r_2</m> the insulation has a low density. 
        Let us use <m> \rho(r)</m> to denote the density as a function of distance <m>r</m> from the center.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, to get <m>V_{\text{layer}}</m> we can use approximate volume as circumference times thickness times length, so
        <m>V \approx (2\pi r_i)(\Delta r)(1 \text{ meter})=(2\pi r_i)(\Delta r)</m>. 
        Thus the mass of a single layer is approximately <me>\text{mass}_i \approx \rho(r_i)(2\pi r_i)(\Delta r).</me>
        Summing both layers, we get that 
        <me> \text{mass} \approx \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^2 \rho(r_i)(2\pi r_i)(\Delta r)</me>
        
        is the total mass of the pipe.
        
        
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <p>
      We can generalize the formula we found in the previous example to any object for which density depends on radius. 
      That more general formula is
      
      <me> \text{mass} \approx \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(r_i)(2\pi r_i)(\Delta r)</me>
      
      where <m>\rho(r)</m> is the density of the object a distance of <m>r_i</m> from the center.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Similar to the earlier applications in this chapter: we will take the limit as <m>\Delta r \rightarrow 0 </m>,
      and doing so turns the sum into an integral.

        For a 2D disk (respectively, 3D cylinder), if the density of the object depends only on the distance from the center point (respectively, center axis)
        according to the function <m>\rho(r)</m>, then the mass per unit length (respectively, mass of the object)  is given by the formula
        
        <me> \text{mass} = \displaystyle \int_{0}^R \rho(r)(2\pi r)\,  dr= \displaystyle \int_{0}^R 2 \pi r\rho(r)\,  dr</me>
        
        
        where <m>R</m> is the outer radius of the object.
        
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    
    <p>
      Note that this formula is almost identical to the one we use for calculating mass of an object with constant cross-sectional area, 
      except that this formula incorporates a factor of <m>2 \pi r</m> (the circumference of a circle) inside the integral.

        <p>
          After an oil spill, scientists measure that the concentration of oil depends on
          the distance from the source according to the function <m>\rho(r)=150 e^{-r^2}</m>
          where <m>r</m> is in miles, and <m>\rho(r)</m> is in barrels per square mile.
          If the spill has reached a maximum radius of 5 miles, how much oil was spilled?

          Since the density depends on the radius, we will use the mass of a disk formula
          
          <m>
            \displaystyle \int_{0}^R \rho(r)(2\pi r)\,  dr
          </m>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For us, the maximum radius is <m>R=5</m> miles, so the total amount of oil is
          
          <me>
            \displaystyle \int_{0}^5 (150e^{-r^2})(2\pi r)\,  dr = \left.-150 \pi e^{-r^2} \right|_0^5 \\
            (-150\pi e^{-(5)^2}) - (-150\pi e^{-(0)^2})=471.23 \text{ barrels}

                Since we have circular cross-sections and their density only depends on the distance
                to the center of the circle (which is the <m>x</m>-axis), we will integrate as we do for a disk.
                Note that our outer radius depends on the <m>x</m>-value, and in fact, the outer radius is
                <m>y=6-x</m>. Therefore,

                What we found in the previous part is the mass per unit length, so just as in
                "Calculating Mass using a Definite Integral", we simply need to integrate
                <m>\rho_{axis}(x)</m> from the endpoints <m>a=0</m> to <m>b=3</m>:

                  = \left. \pi(\frac{1}{6} x^4 - x^3 -18x^2+180x) \right|_{0}^3\\

                which counts the lower-density parts on the outside of the earth more than the higher-density parts near the center.
                For instance, his average treated innermost 1 kilometer of the earth as having the same volume as the outermost 1 kilometer of earth, 
                even though the latter is much larger in terms of volume.

                We will essentially repeat our calculations from parts (a.) and (b.), except with 1200 as the maximum radius instead of 6300.
                
                Therefore, the volume of the inner core is <m>V=\frac{4}{3}\pi (1200)^3=7.24 \times 10^{9}</m> cubic killometers, and the mass is
                
                <me>
                  \text{mass}= \int_0^R 4 \pi r^2 \rho(r)\, dr = \int_0^{1200} 4 \pi r^2(-0.0016r+13)\, dr \\
                  = \left. 4\pi(-0.0004 r^4+\frac{13}{3}r^3) \right |_0^{1200}\\
                  \approx 8.37 \times 10^{10}
                </me>
                
                so the density is <m> (8.37 \times 10^{10})/(7.24 \times 10^{9})=11.56 </m> trillion kilograms per cubic kilometer.

                so dividing gives that approximately <m>1.47 \%</m> of the earth's mass is in the inner core.

      If all of the classes were of the same weight (i.e., the same number of credits),
      the student's GPA would simply be calculated by taking the average

        \frac{3.3 + 3.7 + 2.7 + 2.7}{4} = 3.1

      The weighted average reflects the fact that chemistry and calculus,

      have a greater impact on the students' grade point average.

      each grade gets multiplied by its weight,

      Now consider a thin bar over which density is distributed continuously.
      If the density is constant,

                To find mass we slice the rod horizontally into uniform slices of length

                Then the approximate mass of the <m>i</m>th slice is <m>\rho(x_i) \Delta x</m>.
                Adding the approximations and taking the limit as the number of slices goes to infinity gives us the definite integral

                Using the substitution <m>u = -0.1x</m> and <m>du = -0.1 \ dx</m> we have

                So if the mass is <m>30</m> g, then <m>100\left(1-e^{-0.1a}\right) = 30</m>,
                so <m>1-e^{-0.1a} = 0.3</m>, and <m>e^{-0.1a} = 0.7</m>.
                It follows that <m>-0.1a = \ln(0.7)</m>,

                The mass of the rod is <m>30</m> g, so now we just need to evaluate

                Integrating by parts with <m>u = x</m>, <m>du = dx</m>, <m>dv = e^{-0.1x} \ dx</m>, and <m>v = -10e^{-0.1x}</m> gives us

      <title> Mass of a disk </title>
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Math Olympics gives out prize medals, which are disks with varying density.
          
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The first place medal has a radius of 2 inches, and the density of the disk is given by
                <m>\rho(r)=9-2r</m> where <m>r</m> is the distance from the center of the disk.
                Find the mass of the first place medal.
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <p>
                To make the second place medal, the Math Olympics takes a first-place medal and removes material
                from the outside until the radius is 1.8 inches. Find the mass of the second place medal.
