  <introduction permid="UWB">
    <p permid="pzm">
      Much of our work in <xref ref="C-4">Chapter</xref>
      has been motivated by the velocity-distance problem:
      if we know the instantaneous velocity function, <m>v(t)</m>,
      for a moving object on a given time interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      can we determine the distance it traveled on <m>[a,b]</m>?
      If the velocity function is nonnegative on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      the area bounded by
      <m>y = v(t)</m> and the <m>t</m>-axis on <m>[a,b]</m> is equal to the distance traveled.
      This area is also the value of the definite integral <m>\int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m>.
      If the velocity is sometimes negative,
      the total area bounded by the velocity function still tells us distance traveled,
      while the net signed area tells us the object's change in position.
    </p>

    <p permid="VGv">
      For instance,
      for the velocity function in <xref ref="F-4-4-Intro">Figure</xref>,
      the total distance <m>D</m> traveled by the moving object on <m>[a,b]</m> is
      <me permid="OLQ">
        D = A_1 + A_2 + A_3
      </me>,
      and the total change in the object's position is
      <me permid="uSZ">
        s(b) - s(a) = A_1 - A_2 + A_3
      </me>.
      The areas <m>A_1</m>, <m>A_2</m>,
      and <m>A_3</m> are each given by definite integrals, which
      may be computed by limits of Riemann sums
      (and in special circumstances by geometric formulas).

          Starting with the velocity function given, <m>v(t)=-32t+16</m>, we want to think about what function could give us <m>v(t)</m> as its derivative. Using the power rule, we know that <m>\frac{d}{dt}t^k=kt^{k-1}</m>. In this case, we are starting with some <m>at^{k-1}</m>, so we must add 1 to the exponent and divide by that new exponent to <em>undo</em> the differentiation. So, we get that <m>s(t)=\frac{-32t^2}{2}+\frac{16t}{1}</m>. However, adding a constant to <m>s(t)</m> keeps the derivative <m>v(t)</m> (remember that constants have derivative 0). So, we have most generally that <m>s(t)=-16t^2+16t+c</m>, where <m>c</m> is some constant.
          </p>
          <p> Now we want to find <m>c</m> given the condition that <m>s(0)=32</m>. So, <me>32=s(0)=-16(0)^2+16(0)+c.</me> Therefore, <m>c=32</m>. Then <m>s(t)=-16t^2+16t+32</m>

          Recall that we have a critical point where the derivative of a function is 0, which will result in a maximum point. Since the position function is a quadratic function, this will tell us the time that the water balloon reaches its maximum height. So, let's set the derivative equal to 0: <me>-32t+16=0,</me> so <m>t=0.5</m>. Therefore, after 0.5 seconds the water balloon reaches its maximum height.</p>
        <p>To find the time it takes for the water balloon to land we set the position function equal to 0: <me>-16t^2+16t+32=0</me> <me>-16(t-2)(t+1)=0</me> Thus, it takes 2 seconds for the water balloon to hit the groups.

        <p> We can calculate the area under the curve by breaking this into two triangles. The first triangle has height 16 and width 0.5, so the area is <m>16\cdot 0.5\cdot 0.5=4</m>. The second triangle has a negative height of -48 and width of 1.5, so the area is <m>-48\cdot 1.5\cdot 0.5=-36</m>. Notice that we want to keep the area under the <m>x</m>-axis negative.

    <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>

    <p permid="ObW">
      Suppose we know the position function <m>s(t)</m> and the velocity function <m>v(t)</m> of an object moving in a straight line,
      and for the moment let us assume that <m>v(t)</m> is positive on <m>[a,b]</m>.
      Then, as shown in <xref ref="F-4-4-FTCVel">Figure</xref>,
      we know two different ways to compute the distance,
      <m>D</m>, the object travels:
      one is that <m>D = s(b) - s(a)</m>,
      the object's change in position.
      The other is the area under the velocity curve,
      which is given by the definite integral,
      so <m>D = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ujf">
      Since both of these expressions tell us the distance traveled,
      it follows that they are equal, so
      <men xml:id="E-FTCVel" permid="bai">
        s(b) - s(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt

    <p permid="aqo">
      <xref ref="E-FTCVel">Equation</xref>
      holds even when velocity is sometimes negative,
      because <m>s(b) - s(a)</m>,the object's change in position,
      is also measured by the net signed area on <m>[a,b]</m> which is given by <m>\int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Gxx">
      Perhaps the most powerful fact <xref ref="E-FTCVel">Equation</xref>
      reveals is that we can compute the integral's value if we can find a formula for <m>s</m>.
      Remember, <m>s</m> and <m>v</m> are related by the fact that <m>v</m> is the derivative of <m>s</m>,
      or equivalently that <m>s</m> is an antiderivative of <m>v</m>.

      Note the key lesson of <xref ref="Ex-FTCVel">Example</xref>:
      to find the distance traveled,
      we need to compute the area under a curve,
      which is given by the definite integral.
      But to evaluate the integral,
      we can find an antiderivative,
      <m>s</m>, of the velocity function,
      and then compute the total change in <m>s</m> on the interval.
      In particular,
      we can evaluate the integral without computing the limit of a Riemann sum.

    </figure>

    <p permid="SLP">
     Mathematicians find it convenient to have a shorthand symbol for a function's antiderivative and so we introduce the following notation.
      For a continuous function <m>f</m>,
      we often denote an antiderivative of <m>f</m> by <m>F</m>.
      That is,
      <m>F'(x) = f(x)</m> for all relevant <m>x</m>.
      Using a similar notation <m>V</m> in place of <m>s</m>
      (so that <m>V</m> is an antiderivative of <m>v</m>, that is <m>V'(x)=v(x)</m>)
      in Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E-FTCVel" />, we can write
      <men xml:id="E-FTCV" permid="TvJ">
        V(b) - V(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ySY">
      Now, to evaluate the definite integral
      <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m> for an arbitrary continuous function <m>f</m>,
      we could certainly think of <m>f</m> as representing the velocity of some moving object,
      and <m>x</m> as the variable that represents time.
      But <xref ref="E-FTCVel">Equations</xref>
      and<nbsp /><xref ref="E-FTCV" /> hold for any 
      continuous velocity function,
      even when <m>v</m> is sometimes negative.
      So <xref ref="E-FTCV">Equation</xref>
      offers a shortcut route to evaluating any definite integral,
      provided that we can find an antiderivative of the integrand.
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)
          <idx><h>FTC</h></idx>
      summarizes these observations.

<p>
It is important to note that there is an alternative way of writing the fundamental theorem that is employed in many texts and examples using our convenient notation.  
</p>
<assemblage xml:id="FTC_2"><title>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>
<p>
  If <m>f(x)</m> is a continuous function on <m>[a,b]</m>,

        then <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)</m>.
</p>
</assemblage>
<p>
These two statements of the fundamental theorem are equivalent.  Specifically, many authors choose to denote a function by <m>f</m> and the antiderivative of that function by <m>F</m>.
</p>


    <p permid="Lhq">
      A common alternate notation for <m>F(b) - F(a)</m> is

        F(b) - F(a) = \left.
        F(x) \right|_a^b
      </me>,
      where we read the righthand side as
      <q>the function <m>F</m> evaluated from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.</q>
      In this notation, the FTC says that

      The FTC opens the door to evaluating a wide range of integrals if we can find an antiderivative <m>F</m> for the integrand <m>f</m>.
      For instance since <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\frac{1}{3}x^3] = x^2</m>,
      the FTC tells us that
      <md permid="LRk">
        <mrow>\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx =\mathstrut \amp  \left. \frac{1}{3} \, x^3 \right|_0^1</mrow>

      But finding an antiderivative can be far from simple;
      it is often difficult or even impossible.
      While we can differentiate just about any function,
      even some relatively simple functions don't have an elementary antiderivative.
      A significant portion of integral calculus
      (which is the main focus of second semester college calculus)
      is devoted to the problem of finding antiderivatives.

            Since the units on a rectangle in a Riemann sum are cal/min for the height and min for the width,
            the units of the area of such a rectangle are calories,

            the total calories burned during the first 10 minutes of the workout is given by the definite integral <m>\int_0^{10} c(t) \, dt</m>.
            We use the FTC and evaluate the integral, finding that

            To calculate <m>\int_0^{40} c(t) \, dt</m>,
            we recognize that <m>c(t)</m> is defined in piecewise fashion,

            And finally,

            (or symmetry)
            on <m>30 \le t \le 40</m> that <m>\int_{30}^{40} c(t) \, dt = \frac{400}{3}</m>.

            It makes sense intuitively that there must be at least one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate at which calories are burned,
            as it would be impossible for a continuous instantaneous rate of change to always be above its average value.
            Since we know from (c) that <m>c_{\text{AVG} [0,40]} = \frac{85}{6}</m>,
            and <m>c(t)</m> tells us the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned,
            it follows that we want to solve the equation
            <me permid="vEP">
              c(t) = \frac{85}{6}

            From the graph,
            it appears that there are two such values of <m>t</m> for which this equation is true,
            one in the first ten minutes, and one in the last ten.
            For instance, solving
            <me permid="bLY">
              -0.05t^2 + t + 10 = \frac{85}{6}
            </me>,
            it follows that <m>t = \frac{5}{3}(6 \pm \sqrt{6}) \approx 14.082, 5.918</m>,
            only the second of which lies in <m>0 \le t \le 10</m>.
            So one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate on <m>[0,40]</m> is <m>t = \frac{5}{3}(6 - \sqrt{6}) \approx 5.918</m>.
            Similar reasoning leads to the second time that lies in <m>[30,40]</m>.

        Yes, <m>AV_{[a,b]} = \displaystyle v_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}</m>.
        This is true because of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the definitions of these two quantities.
        In particular,
        <md permid="PlC">
          <mrow>\displaystyle v_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} &amp;= \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b v(t) \, dt</mrow>

          <mrow>&amp;= AV_{a,b}</mrow>
        </md>.
        Average velocity can be thought of in two very different ways:
        one as the change in position divided by change in time,
        the other as an average of the values of <m>v(t)</m> itself.
