          If two quantities that are related,

          are both changing as implicit functions of time,
          how are their rates of change related?
          That is, how does the relationship between the values of the quantities affect the relationship between their respective derivatives with respect to time?

    <p permid="IWr">
      In most of our applications of the derivative so far,
      we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable,
      perhaps called <m>y</m>, changes with respect to another, perhaps called <m>x</m>,
      leading us to compute and interpret <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We next consider situations where several variable quantities are related,
      but where each quantity is implicitly a function of time,
      which will be represented by the variable <m>t</m>.
      Through knowing how the quantities are related,
      we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related.

      For example,
      suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a constant rate<!-- of 20 cubic inches per second-->.
      Since the balloon's volume and radius are related,
      we ought to be able to discover how fast the radius is changing
      by knowing how fast the volume is changing.
      <!--We are interested in questions such as:-->
      Can we determine how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing <!--at the moment the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?-->
      when the balloon is a certain size?

          Starting with the equation <m>V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>, we differentiate both sides with respect to <m>t</m>.

This number is smaller than the one calculated in part (c), so the radius is changing more rapidly when the diameter is <m>12</m> inches.
          Intuitively, this makes sense since the balloon's volume is growing at a constant rate: as the balloon grows, a small change in the radius will have a larger impact on the change in volume; equivalently, the same change in volume corresponds to a smaller change in the radius when the balloon is large.

        <p permid="rYg">
          The information that the height is always half the radius tells us that for all values of <m>t</m>,

          Note that even though we are looking for the rate at which the height changes, the

          Also, observe that <mdash /> rather than substituting expressions into the formula for <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> <mdash /> we
          could instead substitute into the formula for <m>V</m> and recalculate the derivative. Doing so would yield

      Recognizing which geometric relationships are relevant in a given problem 
      is often the key to finding the function to optimize.
      For instance,
      although the problem in <xref ref="act-3-5-1">Example</xref>
      is about a conical tank,
      the most important fact is that there are two similar right triangles involved.
      In another setting,
      we might use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the legs of the triangle.
      But in the conical tank,
      the fact that the water fills the tank so that that the ratio of radius to depth is constant turns out to be the important relationship.
      In other situations where a changing angle is involved,
      trigonometric functions may provide the means to find relationships among various parts of the triangle.

    <p permid="yxm">
      In addition to finding instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time,
      we can often make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time.
      For instance,
      when a conical tank is filling with water at a constant rate,
      it seems obvious that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time.
      Note how carefully we must phrase the relationship:
      we mean to say that while the depth,
      <m>h</m>, of the water is increasing,
      its rate of change, <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>, is decreasing 
      (both as a function of <m>t</m> and as a function of <m>h</m>).
      We make this observation by solving the equation that relates the various rates for one particular rate,
      without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates.
      For instance,
      in the conical tank problem in <xref ref="act-3-5-1">Example</xref>,
      we established that
      <me permid="gtI">
        \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{9}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
      </me>,
      and hence
      <me permid="MAR">
        \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{16}{9\pi h^2} \frac{dV}{dt}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="eEv">
      Provided that <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> is constant,
      it is immediately apparent that as <m>h</m> gets larger,
      <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> will get smaller
      but remain positive.
      Hence, the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.

        To do this, we first need to relate <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.
        The volume of the water in the pool at height
        <m>h \lt 12</m> is the volume of the triangular cross sectional area of height <m>h</m>
        (as shown in the figure below)
        times the width (25 feet) of the pool.
        The height of the triangular cross section is <m>h</m> and the length is distance of the dotted line indicated in the figure.

      <p permid="uWM">
        Placing the cross section on a coordinate system as in the figure,
        the hypotenuse of the triangle is the line connecting the points <m>(0,-15)</m> and <m>(60, -3)</m>.
        This line has slope <m>\frac{12}{60} = 0.2</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,-15)</m>.
        So the equation of this line is <m>y = 0.2x-15</m>.
        It is the <m>x</m> coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>h-15</m> that is the length of the triangle whose height is <m>h</m>.
        So the length <m>l</m> is <m>l = \frac{(h-15)+15}{0.2} = 5h</m>.
        Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height <m>h</m> is

        Both <m>V</m> and <m>h</m> are functions of time.

        feet per minute.
        Since <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> is inversely proportional to <m>h</m>,
        the rate at which the depth of the water increases slows as <m>h</m> increases,

        Each of <m>x</m>, <m>z</m>,
        and <m>\theta</m> is implicitly a function of <m>t</m>.
        We are given that the runner is advancing at a rate of <m>24</m> feet per second,
        so <m>\frac{dx}{dt} = -24</m>.
        Since we want to know <m>\left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{x = 30}</m>,
        we want to relate <m>x</m> and <m>\theta</m>.

      <p permid="nsn">
        We first observe that by definition,
        <me permid="Sud">
          \tan(\theta) = \frac{x}{90} = \frac{1}{90}x
        </me>.
        Having related <m>x</m> and <m>\theta</m>,
        we can differentiate both sides of the preceding equation with respect  to <m>t</m>.
        By the chain rule,
        <me permid="yBm">
          \sec^2 (\theta) \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{90} \frac{dx}{dt}

        and thus
        <me permid="eIv">
          \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{90 \sec^2 (\theta)} \frac{dx}{dt}
        </me>
        At the instant <m>x = 30</m>,
        since <m>x^2 + 90^2 = z^2</m>,
        <m>z = \sqrt{90^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{9000} = 30\sqrt{10}</m>.
        Hence, at this same instance,
        <m>\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{30\sqrt{10}}{90} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{3}</m>.
        Recall we also know that <m>\frac{dx}{dt} = -24</m>.
        Applying this information to the equation that relates the rates of change of <m>x</m> and <m>\theta</m>,
        <me permid="KPE">
          \left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{x = 30} = \frac{1}{90 \left( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{3} \right)^2} (-24) = -\frac{1}{100}(24) = -0.24

      <p permid="Tzw">
        We can draw a figure similar to <xref ref="F-3-5-ConeEx">Figure</xref>
        and let <m>h</m> be the height of the pile at time <m>t</m> and <m>r</m> the pile's base radius.
        Given that <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 10</m> cubic feet per minute,
        we want to know <m>\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{V = 1000}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="zGF">
        We first relate <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.
        We know that <m>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</m>,
        as well as that for every time,
        <m>t</m>, the height and radius are equal so <m>r = h</m>.
        Thus,
        <me permid="qWN">
          V =  \frac{1}{3} \pi h^2 h =  \frac{1}{3} \pi h^3
        </me>
        Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to <m>t</m>
        <me permid="XdW">
          \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{3} \pi \cdot 3h^2 \frac{dh}{dt} = \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
        </me>.
        We note that at the instant <m>V = 1000</m>,
        <m>1000 = \frac{1}{3} \pi h^3</m>,
        so <m>h^3 = \frac{3000}{\pi}</m> and therefore <m>h = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3000}{\pi}}</m>.
        Recall also that <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 10</m>.
        Applying all of this information at the instant
        <m>V = 1000</m> in the equation that relates
        <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>, we have
        <me permid="Dlf">
          10 = \pi \left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3000}{\pi}} \right)^2 \left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{V=1000}

        Thus,
        <me permid="jso">
          \left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{V=1000} = \frac{10}{\pi \left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3000}{\pi}} \right)^2} \approx 0.0328
