<introduction>

    <p permid="riI">Limits are a mathematical construct we can use to describe the behavior of a function near a point.  Consider the function <m>g</m> given by the graph in 
      <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1">Figure </xref> below. We can evaluate the function at a variety of points.  For example, <m>g(-2)=0</m>, <m>g(-1)=3</m>, and <m>g(0)=1</m>.
    </p>
    
        <figure xml:id="F-1-2-PA1" permid="Dxa">
      <caption>Graph of <m>y = g(x)</m>.</caption>
      <image width="47%" source="images/1_2_PA1" />
    </figure>

<p>
A careful look at the graph above shows that <m>g</m> has a removable discontinuity at <m>x=0</m>, 
making <m>g(0)=1</m> even though the overall shape of the graph might lead us to expect <m>g(0)</m> to be <m>4</m>.
In fact, you would probably agree that <q>as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer
            (but NOT equal)
            to <m>0</m>,
            <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to <m>4</m>.</q>
This is the basic idea of a limit and we will expand on this idea in the following section.
</p>



</introduction>

  <subsection permid="BTI">
    <title>The Notion of Limit</title>
    <p permid="NMB">
      Limits give us a way to identify a trend in the values of a function as its input variable approaches a particular value of interest.
      We need a precise understanding of what it means to say 
      <q>a function <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>.</q> 
    </p>

    <p permid="tTK">
      In <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1">Figure</xref>,
      we saw that 
      as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer
      (but NOT equal)
      to 0, <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to the value 4.
      At first, this may feel counterintuitive,
      because the value of <m>g(0)</m> is <m>1</m>, not <m>4</m>.
      Limits describe the behavior of a function
      <em>arbitrarily close to</em> a fixed input
      and are not affected by the value of the function <em>at</em>
      the fixed input.
      More formally,<fn>
      What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit.
      To be completely precise,
      it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say
      <q>as close to <m>L</m> as we like</q>
      and <q>sufficiently close to <m>a</m>.</q>
      That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.
      That being said, the definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.
      </fn> we say the following.
    </p>



    <assemblage permid="upj"><title>Limit of a Function</title>

        <p permid="kzY">
          If a function <m>f</m> is defined on an interval around <m>c</m>, except perhaps at the point <m>x = c</m>,  we define the <term>limit of the function <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></term> to be a number <m>L</m> (if one exists) such that <m>f(x)</m> is as close to  <m>L</m> as we want whenever <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>c</m> (but <m>x \neq c</m>). If <m>L</m> exists, we write <me>\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L</me>.


          On the other hand, if as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> we cannot make <m>f(x)</m> as close to a single value as we would like,
          then we say that <term><m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></term>.
        </p>

    </assemblage>

    <example permid="aws">
      <statement>
        <p permid="QHh">
        Recall the function <m>g</m> from the section introduction, whose graph is reproduced below.
        
    <figure xml:id="F-1-2-PA1prime" permid="Dxa">
      <caption>Graph of <m>y = g(x)</m></caption>
      <image width="47%" source="images/1_2_PA1" />
    </figure>
        
          For the function <m>g</m> pictured in <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1prime">Figure</xref>,
          we make the following observations:
          <me permid="juF">
            \lim_{x \to -1} g(x) = 3, \  \lim_{x \to 0} g(x) = 4, \ \text{and}  \  \lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = 1
          </me>.
          When finding a limit from a graph,
          it suffices to ask if the function <em>approaches</em>
          a single value from each side of the fixed input.
          The function value <em>at</em> the fixed input is irrelevant.
          This reasoning explains the values of the three limits stated above.
        </p>

        <p permid="wOq">
          We further observe that <m>g</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m>  
          because there is a jump in the graph at <m>x = 1</m>.
          If we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the left,
          the function values tend to get close to 3,
          but if we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the right,
          the function values get close to 2.
          There is no single number that all of these function values approach.
          This is why the limit of <m>g</m> does not exist at <m>x = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p permid="aaT">
      For any function <m>f</m>,
      there are typically three ways to answer the question
      <q>does <m>f</m> have a limit at <m>x = a</m>, and if so,
      what is the limit?</q> The first is to reason graphically.
      If we have a formula for <m>f(x)</m>,
      there are two additional possibilities:

      <ol label="1" permid="DIV">
        <li permid="NcH">
          Evaluate the function at a sequence of inputs that approach <m>a</m> on either side
          (typically using some sort of computing technology),
          and ask if the sequence of outputs seems to approach a single value.
        </li>

        <li permid="tjQ">
          Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach <m>a</m>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      The first approach produces only an approximation of the value of the limit,
      while the latter can often be used to determine the limit exactly.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-1-2-Limits" permid="GDB">
      <statement>
        <p permid="cVz">
          For each of the following functions,
          we'd like to know whether or not the function has a limit at the stated <m>c</m>-values.
          Use both numerical and algebraic approaches to investigate and,
          if possible, estimate or determine the value of the limit.
          Compare the results with a careful graph of the function on an interval containing the points of interest.

        <p permid="ORU">
          From <xref ref="table-1-F-1-2-Ex1f">Table</xref>,
          it appears that we can make <m>f</m> as close as we want to 3 by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>-1</m>,
          which suggests that <m>\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = 3</m>.
          This is also consistent with the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> seen in <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1f">Figure</xref>.
          To see this a bit more rigorously and from an algebraic point of view,
          consider the formula for <m>f</m>:
          <m>f(x) = \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}</m>.
          As <m>x</m> approaches <m>-1</m>, the numerator, 
          <m>4-x^2</m>, of <m>f</m> approaches <m>4 - (-1)^2 = 3</m>,
          and the denominator, <m>x+2</m>, of <m>f</m> approaches <m>-1 + 2 = 1</m>. 
          Hence <m>\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = \frac{3}{1} = 3</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="uZd">
          The situation is more complicated when <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m>
          because <m>f(-2)</m> is not defined.
          If we try to use a similar algebraic argument regarding the numerator and denominator,
          we observe that as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m>,
          the numerator <m>(4-x^2)</m> approaches <m>(4 - (-2)^2) = 0</m>,
          and the denominator <m>(x+2)</m> approaches <m>(-2 + 2) = 0</m>, so as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m>,
          the numerator and denominator of <m>f</m> both tend to 0.
          We call <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> an <term>indeterminate form</term>.
              <idx><h>limit</h><h>indeterminate form</h></idx>
          This tells us that there is somehow more work to do.
          From <xref ref="table-2-F-1-2-Ex1f">Table</xref>
          and <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1f">Figure</xref>,
          it appears that <m>f</m> should have a limit of <m>4</m> at <m>x = -2</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="bgm">
          To see algebraically why this is the case, observe that
          <md permid="PBO">
            <mrow>\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = \amp  \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp  \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{(2-x)(2+x)}{x+2}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p permid="Hnv">
          It is important to observe that
          because we are taking the limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m>,
          we are considering <m>x</m> values that are close,
          but not equal, to <m>-2</m>.
          Since we never actually allow <m>x</m> to equal <m>-2</m>,
          the quotient <m>\frac{2+x}{x+2}</m> has value 1 for every possible value of <m>x</m>.
          Thus, we can simplify the most recent expression above,
          and find that
          <me permid="vIX">
            \lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2} (2-x)
          </me>.
          This limit is now easy to determine,
          and its value is <m>4</m>.
          Thus, from several points of view we've seen that <m>\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = 4</m>.

          First, as <m>x</m> approaches <m>3</m>, it appears from the values in <xref ref="table-1-F-1-2-Ex1g">Table</xref>
          that the function is approaching a number between <m>0.86601</m> and <m>0.86604</m>.
          From the graph in <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1g">Figure</xref> it appears that <m>g(x)</m> approaches <m>g(3)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>3</m>.
          The exact value of <m>g(3) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{3})</m> is <m>\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>,
          which is approximately 0.8660254038.
          This is convincing evidence that
          <me permid="bQg">
            \lim_{x \to 3} g(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
          </me>.

        <p permid="zIW">
          As <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>, we observe that
          <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> does not behave in an elementary way.
          When <m>x</m> is positive and approaching zero,
          we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values,
          and <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> increases without bound.
          When <m>x</m> is negative and approaching zero,
          <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> decreases without bound.
          In this sense, as we get close to <m>x = 0</m>,
          the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly,
          and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of <m>g</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>.
          If we plot the function
          <m>g(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)</m> with a graphing utility and then zoom in on <m>x = 0</m>,
          we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin,
          which suggests that <m>g</m> does not have a limit at <m>x = 0</m>.

          How do we reconcile the graph in <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1g">Figure</xref> with <xref ref="table-2-F-1-2-Ex1g">Table</xref>,
          which seems to suggest that the limit of <m>g</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m> may in fact be <m>0</m>?
          The data misleads us because of the special nature of the sequence of input values <m>\{0.1, 0.01, 0.001, \ldots\}</m>.
          When we evaluate <m>g(10^{-k})</m>,
          we get <m>g(10^{-k}) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{10^{-k}}\right) = \sin(10^k \pi) = 0</m> for each positive integer value of <m>k</m>.
          But if we take a different sequence of values approaching zero,
          say <m>\{0.3, 0.03, 0.003, \ldots\}</m>, then we find that
          <me permid="HXp">
            g(3 \cdot 10^{-k}) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3 \cdot 10^{-k}}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{10^k \pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866025

        <p permid="LXo">
          That sequence of function values suggests that the value of the limit is <m>\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>.
          Clearly the function cannot have two different values for the limit,
          so <m>g</m> has no limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>.

    <title>Having a Limit at a Point</title>

     We saw earlier that <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> provided that we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal to)
      <m>c</m>.
      If so, we write
      <m>\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L</m>.
      
      We also saw that there are cases where a function can fail to have a limit.  The graphs that follow are two such examples.

        <figure xml:id="F-1-7-NoLimit" permid="TXz">

    <p permid="WSf">
      Essentially there are two behaviors that a function can exhibit near a point where it fails to have a limit.
      In <xref ref="F-1-7-NoLimit">Figure</xref> above,
      at the left we see a function <m>f</m> whose graph shows a jump at <m>c = 1</m>.
      If we let <m>x</m> approach 1 from the left side,
      the value of <m>f</m> approaches 2, but if we let <m>x</m> approach <m>1</m> from the right,
      the value of <m>f</m> tends to 3.
      Because the value of <m>f</m> does not approach a single number as <m>x</m> gets arbitrarily close to 1 from both sides,
      we know that <m>f</m> does not have a limit at <m>c = 1</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="CZo">
      For such cases, we introduce the notion of
      <em>left</em> and <em>right</em>
      (or <em>one-sided</em>)
      limits.

      Precisely because the left and right limits are not equal,
      the overall limit of <m>f</m> as <m>x \to 1</m> fails to exist.

      For the function <m>g</m> pictured at the right of <xref ref="F-1-7-NoLimit">Figure</xref>,
      the function fails to have a limit at <m>c = 1</m> for a different reason.
      While the function does not have a jump in its graph at <m>c = 1</m>,
      it is still not the case that <m>g</m> approaches a single value as <m>x</m> approaches 1.
      In particular,
      due to the infinitely oscillating behavior of <m>g</m> to the right of <m>c = 1</m>,
      we say that the (right-hand) limit of <m>g</m> as <m>x \to 1^+</m> does not exist,

    <title>Limits and Continuity</title>

    <p permid="AeI">
      Recall that informally we said
      a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without ever lifting our pencil from the page.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-7-Cont" permid="kVK">

      Using limits, we can formalize the idea of continuity.
      First consider the function in the left-most graph of <xref ref="F-1-7-Cont">Figure</xref> above.
      Note that <m>f(1)</m> is not defined,
      which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>c = 1</m>.
      We will naturally say that <m>f</m> is
      <em>not continuous at <m>c = 1</m></em>.
      For the function <m>g</m>,
      we observe that while <m>\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 3</m>,
      the value of <m>g(1)</m> is <m>2</m>,
      and thus the limit does not equal the function value.
      Here, too, we will say that <m>g</m> is
      <em>not continuous</em>,
      even though the function is defined at <m>c = 1</m>.
      Finally, the function <m>h</m> appears to be the most well-behaved of all three,
      since at <m>c = 1</m> its limit and its function value agree.
      That is,
      <me permid="SSg">
        \lim_{x \to 1} h(x) = 3 = h(1)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Mta">
      With no hole or jump in the graph of <m>h</m> at <m>c = 1</m>,
      we say that <m>h</m> is
      <em>continuous</em> there.
      More formally, we make the following definition.

      Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c),

      The definition says that a function is continuous at <m>x = c</m> provided that its limit as <m>x \to c</m> exists and equals its function value at <m>x = c</m>.
      If a function is continuous at every point in an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      we say the function is <q>continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>.</q>
      If a function is continuous at every point in its domain,
      we simply say the function is <q>continuous.</q> Thus we note that
      continuous functions are particularly nice:
      to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point,
      all we need to do is evaluate the function.

      For example, consider <m>p(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3</m>.
      It can be proved that every polynomial is a continuous function at every real number,

      This route of substituting an input value to evaluate a limit works whenever we know that the function being considered is continuous.

      as are many other familiar functions and combinations thereof.

    <subsection><title>Summary of Limits and Continuity</title>
        <p>The concepts discussed in the last two sections will be important in later sections. The following is a short summary of these sections and an example that ties together the concepts of limits and continuity.
        <ul>
            <li>For a function <m>f</m> defined on an interval around a number <m>c</m>, <me>\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L</me> means that the value of <m>f(x)</m> gets as close as we want to a number <m>L</m> whenever <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>c</m>, assuming the value <m>L</m> exists.</li>
            <li>We define a limit from the left and a limit from the right in the same way as above, while adding the stipulation that <m>x\lt c</m> for the left limit and <m>x\gt c</m> for the right limit. That is, as we move <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>c</m> <em>from the left</em> on a number line (<m>x\lt c</m>), <m>f(x)</m> gets as close to the limit value as we want. Similarly for the limit from the right.</li>
            <li>The one-sided limits help to determine if a limit exists as <m>x</m> approaches a value <m>c</m>. More specifically, <m>\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L</m> if and only if <m>\lim_{x \rightarrow c^-} f(x)=L=\lim_{x \rightarrow c^+} f(x)</m> </li>
