  <introduction permid="BlB">
  
  <p>
 In <xref ref="sec-5-3-diff">Section</xref>, we learned that a <em> differential equation </em> is an equation that provides a description of a function's derivative, which means that it tells us the function's rate of change. In this chapter we will learn several methods for solving differential equations. We start by revisiting what a differential equation is. </p>
  






    <p permid="EQb">
    
    
    
      Differential equations arise frequently in our every day world.
      For instance, you may hear a bank advertising:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="hsK">
      <p permid="HKH">
        <em>Your money will grow at a 3<percent /> annual interest rate with us.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="kXk">
      This innocuous statement is really a differential equation.
      Let's
      translate: <m>A(t)</m> will be amount of money you have in your account at
      time <m>t</m>.
      The rate at which your money grows is the
      derivative <m>dA/dt</m>, and we are told that this rate is
      <m>0.03 A</m>.
      This leads to the differential equation
      <me permid="oBK">
        \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.03 A
      </me>.
    </p>




    <p permid="Ret">
      This differential equation has a slightly different feel than the previous equation <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1</m>.
      In the earlier example,
      the rate of change depends only on the independent variable <m>t</m>,
      and we may find <m>s(t)</m> by integrating the velocity <m>4t+1</m>.
      In the banking example, however,
      the rate of change depends on the dependent variable <m>A</m>,
      so we'll need some new techniques in order to find <m>A(t)</m>.
    </p>

<example xml:id="act-7-1-1" permid="DUv">
  <statement>
    <p permid="mWk">
      Express the following statements as
      differential equations.
      In each case, you will need to introduce notation
      to describe the important quantities in the statement so be sure to
      clearly state what your notation means.

    <title>Differential Equations in the World Around Us</title>
    <p permid="xlC">
      Differential equations give a natural way to describe phenomena we see in the real world.
      For instance,
      physical principles are frequently expressed as a description of how a quantity changes.
      A good example is Newton's Second Law,
      which says:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="NzT">
      <p permid="nRQ">
        <em>The product of an object's mass and acceleration equals the force applied to it. </em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="dsL">
      For instance,
      when gravity acts on an object near the earth's surface,
      it exerts a force equal to <m>mg</m>,
      the mass of the object times the
      gravitational constant <m>g</m>.
      We therefore have
      <md permid="UIT">
        <mrow>ma =\mathstrut \amp  mg, \ \text{or}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{dv}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  g</mrow>
      </md>,
      where <m>v</m> is the velocity of the object,
      and <m>g = 9.8</m> meters per
      second squared.
      Notice that this physical principle does not tell us
      what the object's
      velocity is, but rather how the object's velocity changes.

<example xml:id="act-7-1-2" permid="dQT">
  <statement>

      Shown below are two graphs depicting the velocity of falling objects.

      To estimate <m>\frac{dv}{dt}</m> at a particular time,
      we must estimate the slope of the tangent line for the graph of <m>v</m> at that point.
      For parts (a) and (b),
      we draw tangent lines and measure the slopes of the tangent lines.
      These values are approximations.

<subsection><title>Types of Differential Equations</title>
  <p permid="XDz">
      To close this section,
      we note that differential equations may be classified based on certain characteristics they may possess.
      You may see many different types of differential equations in a later course in differential equations.
      For now, we would like to introduce a few terms that are used to describe differential equations.
    </p>

<assemblage>
<title> Order of a differential equation </title>
<p>
The <term>  order </term> of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that appears in the equation.
</p>
</assemblage>



    <p permid="DKI">
      For example, a <em>first-order</em> differential equation
          <idx><h>differential equation</h><h>first order</h></idx>
      is one in which only the
      first derivative of the function occurs.
      For this reason,
      <me permid="xVw">
        \frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v
      </me>
      is a first-order equation while
      <me permid="ecF">
        \frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -10y
      </me>
      is a second-order equation.
    </p>

<assemblage>
<title> Autonomous differential equation </title>
    <p permid="jRR">
      A differential equation is <term>autonomous</term>
          <idx><h>autonomous</h></idx>
          <idx><h>differential equation</h><h>autonomous</h></idx>
      if the independent
      variable does not appear in the description of the derivative.
      </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      
      <p>
      For instance,
      <me permid="KjO">
        \frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v
      </me>
      is autonomous because the description of the derivative <m>dv/dt</m> does
      not depend on time.
      The equation
      <me permid="qqX">
        \frac{dy}{dt} = 1.5t - 0.5y
      </me>,
      however, is not autonomous.

              What happens to this solution after a long time?
              Assuming that <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}</m>, we observe that
              <me permid="pja">

              The two preceding equations show that

              and thus this function is a solution to the differential equation.
              Moreover, <m>T(0) = 75 + 30e^0 = 75 + 30 = 105</m>,
              so the function satisfies the initial condition, too.
              Finally, because <m>e^{-t/15} \to 0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>,
              it follows that <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15} \to 75</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>,
              which shows that the solution function's value tends to room temperature as time increases without bound,
