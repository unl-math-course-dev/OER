  <introduction permid="tMG">
    <p permid="lcO">
      A powerful feature of mathematics is that it can be studied both as an abstract discipline and as an applied one.
      For instance,
      calculus can be developed almost entirely as an abstract collection of ideas that focus on properties of functions.
      At the same time,
      if we consider functions that represent meaningful processes,
      calculus can describe our experience of physical reality.
      We have already seen that for the position function
      <m>y = s(t)</m> of a ball being tossed straight up in the air,
      the derivative of the position function,
      <m>v(t) = s'(t)</m>, gives the ball's velocity at time <m>t</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="RjX">
      In this section,
      we investigate several functions with specific physical meaning
      and consider how the units on the independent variable,
      dependent variable,
      and the derivative function add to our understanding.
      To start, we consider the familiar problem of a position function of a moving object.

      For the first <m>57</m> minutes, the car travels away from Gackle at a constant speed.
      Since it travels a total of <m>63.8</m> miles during this time, its velocity is 
      <m>\frac{63.8}{57}</m> miles per minute, or approximately <m>67.16</m> miles per hour. 
      The car is stopped between minutes <m>57</m> and <m>68</m>, and then resumes 
      driving away from Gackle, again at a constant speed.
      Between <m>68</m> and <m>104</m> minutes, the car travels <m>106.8-63.8=43</m> miles, 
      so its (average) velocity during this time is <m>\frac{43}{104-68}=\frac{43}{36}</m>
      miles per minute, or about <m>71.67</m> miles per hour.
      </p>

      <li>
      <p>
      The slope of the line between the points <m>(57,63.8)</m> and <m>(104,106.8)</m>
      is <m>m=\frac{106.8-63.8}{104-57}=\frac{43}{57}\approx0.754</m> miles per minute.
      This value represents the average speed of the car between <m>57</m> and <m>104</m> minutes of 
      driving. Because the car is stopped for the first <m>11</m> minutes of this time interval, 
      the average speed on this interval is down to approximately <m>45</m> miles per hour.

      The average rate of change of the car's position on the interval <m>[68,104]</m>
      is <me>AV_{[68,104]}=\frac{106.8-63.8}{104-68}=\frac{43}{36}\approx1.194</me> miles per minute. 
      On this interval, the car travels at an average speed of <m>72</m> miles per hour.

      <li>
      <p>
      At <m>t=80</m> minutes, we are solidly in the middle of the time interval <m>[68,104]</m>, 
      during which the car appears to be traveling at a constant velocity of about <m>72</m> miles per hour. 
      A constant velocity (and in general, a linear position function) on an interval means the 
      instantaneous velocity of the car at a point on that interval is the same as the average 
      velocity of the car over that interval. 
      Therefore, the instantaneous rate of change of the car's position at the moment <m>t=80</m>
      minutes is about <m>72</m> miles per hour, or <m>1.2</m> miles per minute.

    <title>Units of the Derivative Function</title>
    <p permid="xrg">
      As we now know,
      the derivative of the function <m>f</m> at a fixed value <m>x</m> is given by
      <me permid="zgt">
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>,
      and this value has several different interpretations.
      If we set <m>x = a</m>,
      one meaning of <m>f'(a)</m> is the slope of the tangent line at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="dyp">
      We also sometimes write <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m> or
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> instead of <m>f'(x)</m>,
      and these alternate notations help us see the units
      (and thus the meaning)
      of the derivative as
      <em>the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m></em>.
          <idx><h>instantaneous rate of change</h></idx>
      The units on the slope of the secant line,
      <m>\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m>,
      are <q>units of <m>y</m> per unit of <m>x</m>,</q> and
      when we take the limit as <m>h</m> goes to zero,
      the derivative <m>f'(x)</m> has the same units:
      units of <m>y</m> per unit of <m>x</m>.

      It is helpful to remember that the units on the derivative function are
      <q>units of output per unit of input,</q> for the variables
      of the original function.
    </p>

    <example>
    <p permid="JFy">
      Suppose that the function <m>y = P(t)</m>
      measures the population of a city
      (in thousands)
      at the start of year <m>t</m>
      (where <m>t = 0</m> corresponds to 2010 AD).
      We are told that <m>P'(2) = 21.37</m>.
      What is the meaning of this value?
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>P</m> is measured in thousands and <m>t</m> is measured in years,
      we can say that the instantaneous rate of change of the city's population with respect to time at the start of 2012 is 21.37 thousand people per year.
      We therefore expect that in the coming year,
      about 21,370 people will be added to the city's population.

  <subsection><title>Tangent Lines</title>
  
 <p>
 Recall that a line can be written as <m>y=m(x-x_0)+y_0</m> where <m>m</m> is the slope of the line and <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is a point on the line.  Using this information we are in a position to quickly find the equation for the tangent line to a curve at a point.  Specifically, we have the following definition.
  </p>
 
 <p xml:id="Tandef" permid="Tandef">
 <idx><h>tangent line</h><h>equation</h></idx>
 <assemblage><title>The Tangent Line</title>
 <p>Given a differentiable function <m>f</m> and a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> the equation for the <term>tangent line to the function <m>f</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m></term> is given by
 <me>y=f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+y_0.</me></p>
 </assemblage> 
 </p>

  <example>
  <p>
  We can find the equation of the line tangent to the curve given by graphing <m>y=f(x)</m> where <m>f(x)=x^2+2</m> at <m>(2,3)</m> by first noting that 
  <me>
  f'(x)=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(x+h)^2+2-x^2-2}{h}=2x
  </me>.
  Therefore the equation of the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>(2,3)</m> is
  <me>
  y=f'(2)(x-2)+3=4(x-2)-3=4x-5
  </me>.
  </p>
  
  </example>
  
  <p>We will look more at tangent lines in future sections but the basic ideas appear here.  Specifically, if we know data about a function at a specific point such as it's value at that point and rate of change at that point then we can estimate its value at a future point.</p>

          We know that <m>f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h}</m>.
          But since we don't have a graph or a formula for the function,
          we can neither sketch a tangent line nor evaluate the limit algebraically.
          We can't even use smaller and smaller values of <m>h</m> to estimate the limit.
          Instead, we have just two choices:
          using <m>h = -1</m> or <m>h = 1</m>,
          depending on which point we pair with <m>(2,3.25)</m>.

          So, one estimate is
          <me permid="fnC">
            f'(2) \approx \frac{f(1)-f(2)}{1-2} = \frac{2.5-3.25}{-1} = 0.75

          The other is

            f'(2) \approx \frac{f(3)-f(2)}{3-2} = \frac{3.625-3.25}{1} = 0.375
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="YOw">
          Because the first approximation looks backward from the point
          <m>(2,3.25)</m> and the second approximation looks forward,
          it makes sense to average these two estimates in order to account for behavior on both sides of <m>x=2</m>.
          Doing so, we find that
          <me permid="rBU">
            f'(2) \approx \frac{0.75 + 0.375}{2} = 0.5625

      <m>\frac{f(3)-f(2)}{3-2} = 0.375</m>.
      Note how the first slope overestimates the slope of the tangent line at <m>(2,f(2))</m>,
      while the second slope underestimates <m>f'(2)</m>.

      <me permid="XJd">

    </p>

    <p permid="iii">
      Note that this central difference has the same value as the average of the forward and backward differences
      (and it is straightforward to explain why this always holds).
      The central difference yields a very good approximation to the derivative's value,
      because it yields a line closer to being parallel to the tangent line.

              Note, though,
              the the value of the car is always decreasing and <m>h'(m)</m> is always negative.

              A new car decreases in value very quickly at first,

              its value will depreciate to near zero.
              So <m>h</m> is a decreasing function.
              Since the value of our car always decreases,
              it follows that <m>h'(m) \lt 0</m> for all <m>m \gt 0</m>.
              The fact that the depreciation slows as <m>m</m> increases implies that <m>h'</m> is an increasing

              function.
              Since <m>h'</m> is increasing,
