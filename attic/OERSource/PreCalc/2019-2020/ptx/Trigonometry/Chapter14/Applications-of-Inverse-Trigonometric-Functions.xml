<title>Applications of Inverse Trigonometric Functions</title>

<introduction>

<p> </p>

<p>
	In the previous section, we learned how to solve basic trigonometric equations like <m>\sin(\theta)=1/2</m>. In this section, we will consider more complicated trig equations and explore how to solve these equations for all possible solutions as well as solutions on a given interval.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection> <title> Solving More Complicated Trig Equations </title>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Solve the trigonometric equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m> for all possible values of <m>\theta</m>. </p> </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
        	Similar to the examples in the previous section, we can sketch a graph of <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m> to see where it intersects with the line <m>y=1</m>. Just like before, the angles that correspond to the intersection points of these two functions are the solutions to the equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>. If we look at the graph, we can see that there are an infinite number of solutions to this equation. </p>
        <sidebyside width='100%'><image source="images/imagesChap14/sin3thetaExample.png"><description>graph of 2sin(3theta)=1</description></image></sidebyside>
		<p>
        	The key difference between this example and examples that we've seen before is that we now have an input of <m>3\theta</m> instead of just <m>\theta</m> into our sine function. To solve this equation, we need to identify all angles, <m>\theta</m>, such that <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>. </p>
        <p>
        	To solve this problem, we can first isolate the sine function by dividing each side of the equation by 2, which gives us <me>\sin(3\theta)=\frac{1}{2}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	While we know what angles have a sine value of <m>1/2</m>, it is less clear how to proceed when we have <m>3\theta</m> as our input. To make the problem more familiar, we can introduce a new variable <m>\phi</m> and set <m>\phi=3\theta</m>. Then, substituting <m>\phi</m> into our equation, we get <me>\sin(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	In <xref ref='sin-one-half-example' />, we found that the solutions to this equation are <me> \phi = \frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \phi = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	Since we want to solve for all possible values of <m>\theta</m>, we can use our substitution and replace <m>\phi</m> with <m>3\theta</m> in the solutions above. Therefore, we have that <me> 3\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} 3\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	Our final step in solving for <m>\theta</m> is to divide each side of the equations by 3, so we have <me> \theta = \frac{\frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k}{3} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{\frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k}{3} \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	and simplifying we get <me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18} + \frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
		<p>
			Notice that when we divide the right side of our equations by 3, we must divide each term by 3 in order to simplify the equations. Therefore, we end up adding multiples of <m>2\pi/3</m> to our initial solutions instead of multiples of <m>2\pi</m>. Also note that the sine function we are dealing with, <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m>, has a period of <m>2\pi/3</m>. </p>
		<!--<p>
			If we look back at the original equation, <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>, we see that the sine function <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m> has a period of <m>2\pi/3</m>, which is reflected in the solution sets. </p>-->
		<!--<p>
			We can also relate these solution sets back to the intersection points on the graph above. When <m>k=0</m>, we get the two initial solutions <m>\theta=\pi/18</m> and <m>\theta=5\pi/18</m>, shown on the graph below. </p>-->
    </solution>

<subsection> <title> Solutions on a Given Interval </title>

<p>
	In our previous examples, we have solved trigonometric equations for all solutions. However, we can also find a finite number of solutions on a given interval. The next example addresses this situation. </p>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Solve the trigonometric equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m> for all values of <m>\theta</m> in the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>. </p> </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
        	We solved this equation in the previous example above for all possible values of <m>\theta</m>. We found that <me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18} + \frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
		<p>
			To find values of <m>\theta</m> in the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>, we must test values of <m>k</m>. To better organize our work, we will create a "<m>k</m>-table" where we can keep track of different values of <m>k</m>, the angle <m>\theta</m> they yield, and whether or not that angle is in the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>.</p>

    <p>Notice that for both positive and negative values of <m>k</m>, we stopped as soon as we reached a value of <m>\theta</m> that was outside of the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>. This is because for positive values of <m>k</m>, <m>\theta</m> was getting larger, so once <m>\theta</m> was greater than <m>\pi</m> it would always be greater than <m>\pi</m>. Similarly, when <m>k</m> was negative, <m>\theta</m> was getting more negative, so once it was less than <m>-\pi</m> it would always be less than <m>-\pi</m>. Therefore from the table we can see that there are exactly six solutions in the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>:
    <me>-\frac{11\pi}{18}, \ -\frac{7\pi}{18}, \ \frac{\pi}{18}, \ \frac{5\pi}{18}, \ \frac{13\pi}{18}, \ \frac{17\pi}{18}</me>
    </p>
    </solution>
</example>

<p>
    We can also use more complex algebraic techniques, such as factoring, to solve trigonometric equations. Consider the function <m>f(x) = 2x^2+x</m>. If you were asked to solve <m>f(x) = 0</m>, you could use algebra to arrive at two solutions. </p>

<p>
    First, we set <m>\ 2x^2+x = 0 \ </m> and factor, which gives us <me> x(2x + 1) = 0 </me> </p>

<p>
    Now, since the terms <m>\ x \ </m> and <m>\ 2x+1 \ </m> multiply together to equal 0, we know that either <m>\ x=0 \ </m> or <m>\ 2x+1=0 \ </m>. Therefore, we get the two solutions <me>x=0 \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} x=-\frac{1}{2}</me> </p>

<p>
    Following the same steps, we can solve the equation <m>f(\theta) = 0</m> where <m> f(\theta) = 2\sin^2(\theta) + \sin(\theta)</m>. We get that </p>
<md>
    <mrow> 2\sin^2(\theta) + \sin(\theta) \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Factoring out } \sin(\theta) </mrow>
    <mrow> </mrow>
    <mrow> \sin(\theta)\Big(2\sin(\theta) + 1\Big) \amp = 0 \amp\amp </mrow> </md>

<p>
    Like before, we have two terms that multiply together to get 0. Therefore, we know that either
    <me> \sin(\theta) = 0 \hspace{.25in} \text{ or } \hspace{.25in} 2\sin(\theta) + 1 = 0 </me>
We must now solve each of these equations to get a complete set of solutions. </p>

<p>
    Solving the equation <m>\ \sin(\theta) = 0 \ </m> gives us the solutions <m>...,-\pi,0,\pi,2\pi,...</m> which can be represented as the solution set
        <me> \theta = \pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{where } k \text{ is any integer}</me> </p>

<p>
    Solving the equation <m>\ 2\sin(\theta) + 1 = 0 </m> we get <m>\displaystyle \sin(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2} </m>, which gives us the solution set
    <me> \theta = \frac{7\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{11\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>

<p>
    Therefore, the solutions to the original equation <m>\ 2\sin^2(\theta) + \sin(\theta)  = 0 \ </m> are
        <md>
            <mrow> \theta \amp = \pi, \amp\amp </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> \theta \amp = \frac{7\pi}{6}+2\pi k, \amp\amp \text{and} </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> \theta \amp = \frac{11\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \amp\amp \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </mrow> </md> </p>

<example>
    <statement>
    <p>
        Solve <m>\ 3\sec^2(\theta) - 5\sec(\theta) = 2 \ </m> for all solutions with <m>0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi</m>. </p></statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Consider the function <m>f(x)=3x^2-5x</m>. If you were asked to find all solutions to <m>f(x)=2</m>, you could use algebra to arrive at two solutions:</p>
      <md>
        <mrow> 3x^2-5x \amp = 2 </mrow>
        <mrow> 3x^2-5x-2 \amp = 0 </mrow>
        <mrow> (x-2)(3x+1) \amp = 0. </mrow>
      </md>
      <p>Therefore, we get the two solutions
        <me>x=2 \text{ and } x=-\frac{1}{3}.</me>
      Following these steps as above with <m>\sec(\theta)</m> instead of <m>x</m>, we know that either
        <me>\sec(\theta)=2 \text{ or } \sec(\theta)=-\frac{1}{3},</me>
            or equivalently, either
              <me>\cos(\theta)=\frac{1}{2} \text{ or } \cos(\theta)=-3,</me>
      There are no solutions to the equation <m>\cos(\theta)=-3</m>, so we need only consider <m>\cos(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}</m>. Solving the equation <m>\cos(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}</m>, we get two solution sets. First,</p>
      <md>
        <mrow> \theta \amp = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \frac{\pi}{3} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer}. </mrow>
      </md>
      <p>Using symmetry, the other solution set for <m>\cos(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}</m> has base angle <m>-\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, which gives
        <me> \theta = -\frac{\pi}{3} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer}. </me>
      Finally, we need to determine which solutions lie in the interval <m>0\le\theta\le 2\pi</m>. We will do this by constructing a table of <m>k</m>-values, starting at <m>k=0</m> and increasing <m>k</m> until we are outside of the interval, and then at <m>k=-1</m> and descreasing until we are outside of the interval.

        Notice that one value of <m>k</m> can yield a solution for one solution set and a non-solution for the other solutions set! From the table above, we can see that there are exactly two solutions to the original equation <m>3\sec^2(\theta)-5\sec(\theta)=2</m> in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m>:</p>

<example>
    <statement><p>
        Solve <m>\ 2\sin^2(\theta)+3\sin(\theta) = -1 \ </m> for all solutions with <m>0 \leq \theta \le 2\pi</m>.

    <solution>
      <p>Consider the function <m>f(x)=2x^2+3x</m>. If you were asked to find all solutions to <m>f(x)=-1</m>, you could use algebra to arrive at two solutions:</p>

      We can use the unit circle to solve <m>\sin(\theta)=-\frac{1}{2}</m>. There are two initial solutions, namely <m>\theta=\frac{7\pi}{6}</m> and <m>\theta=\frac{11\pi}{6}</m>. This leads to the following two solution sets:</p>

      <p>
        We can use the unit circle to solve <m>\sin(\theta)=-1</m> as well. There is just one initial solution, <m>\theta=\frac{3\pi}{2}</m>. Thus we get a third solution set
