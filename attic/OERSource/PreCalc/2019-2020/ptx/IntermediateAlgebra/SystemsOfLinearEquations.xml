<introduction>


<p>Real-world applications are often modeled using more than one variable and more than one equation. A system of equations consists of a set of two or more equations with the same variables. In this section, we will study linear systems consisting of two linear equations each with two variables.  The system

<me>
        \begin{cases}
        2x-3y\amp =0\\
        -4x+2y\amp =-8
        \end{cases}
</me>
is one such system. </p>

<p>A solution to a linear system, or simultaneous solution, is an ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m> that solves both of the equations. In this case, <m>(3,2)</m> is the only solution. To check that an ordered pair is a solution, substitute the corresponding <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values into each equation and then simplify to see if you obtain a true statement for both equations.</p>

<subsection><title>Solving by Graphing</title>
    <p>Geometrically, a linear system consists of two lines, where a solution is a point of intersection. To illustrate this, we will graph the following linear system with a solution of <m>(3,2)</m>:</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>
            \begin{cases}
            2x-3y\amp =0\\
            -4x+2y\amp =-8
            \end{cases}
        </mrow>
    </md>

    <p>First, we will rewrite the equations in slope-intercept form so that we may easily graph them.</p>

    <p>First Equation:<md>
        <mrow>
            \begin{aligned}
            2x-3y\amp =0\\
            2x-3y\alert{-2x}\amp =0\alert{-2x}\\
            -3y\amp =-2x\\
            \frac{-3y}{\alert{-3}}\amp =\frac{-2x}{\alert{-3}}\\
            y\amp=\frac{2}{3}x
            \end{aligned}
        </mrow>
    </md>

Second Equation:<md>
    <mrow>
        \begin{aligned}
        -4x+2y\amp =-8\\
       -4x+2y\alert{+4x}\amp =-8\alert{+4x}\\
        2y\amp =4x-8\\
        \frac{2y}{\alert{2}}\amp =\frac{4x-8}{\alert{2}}\\
        y\amp=2x-4
        \end{aligned}
    </mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>Next, replace these forms of the original equations in the system to obtain what is called an <term>equivalent system</term>. Equivalent systems share the same solution set.</p>

<md>
    <mrow>\amp\alert{\text{Original System   }}\amp\alert{\text{Equivalent System}}</mrow>
    <mrow>
        \amp\begin{cases}
        2x-3y\amp =0\\
        -4x+2y\amp =-8
        \end{cases} \, \implies
        \amp\begin{cases}
        y\amp =\frac{2}{3}x\\
        y\amp =2x-4
        \end{cases}
    </mrow>
</md>

<p>If we graph both of the lines on the same set of axes, then we can see that the point of intersection is indeed <m>(3, 2)</m>, the solution to the system.</p>

<p>To summarize, linear systems described in this section consist of two linear equations each with two variables. A solution is an ordered pair that corresponds to a point where the two lines intersect in the rectangular coordinate plane. Therefore, one way to solve linear systems is by graphing both lines on the same set of axes and determining the point where they cross. This describes the <term>graphing method</term> for solving linear systems.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Solve the system of equations by graphing it.: <m>\begin{cases}
            x-y\amp =-4\\

            \end{cases}</m>.
        </p></statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Rewrite the linear equations in slope-intercept form.
            </p>

            First Equation:<me>
                \begin{aligned}
                x-y\amp =-4\\
                -y\amp =-x-4\\
                \frac{-y}{\alert{-1}}\amp =\frac{-x-4}{\alert{-1}}\\
                y\amp = x+4
                \end{aligned}
                </me>

            Second Equation:<me>
                \begin{aligned}
                2x+y\amp =1\\
                y\amp = -2x+1

<p>The graphing method for solving linear systems is not ideal when a solution consists of coordinates that are not integers. The goal of the graphing method is to understand the geometry involved when solving systems. It is important to remember that the solutions to a system correspond to the point, or points, where the graphs of the equations intersect.</p>

<subsection><title>The Substitution Method</title>
<p>In this section, we review a completely algebraic technique for solving systems, the <term>substitution method</term>. The idea is to solve one equation for one of the variables and substitute the result into the other equation. After performing this substitution step, we are left with a single equation with one variable, which can be solved using algebra.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Solve by substitution: <m>\begin{cases}
            2x+y\amp =-3\\
            3x-2y\amp =-8
            \end{cases}</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        We can solve for either variable in either equation. If we choose the first equation, we can isolate <m>y</m> in one step.
    </p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        2x+y\amp = -3\\
        y\amp = -2x-3
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

<p>Substitute the expression <m>-2x-3</m> for the variable <m>y</m> in the <em>other</em> equation.</p>

<me> 3x-2(\alert{-2x-3})=-8</me>


<p>This leaves us with an equivalent equation with one variable, which can be solved using the techniques learned up to this point. Solve for the remaining variable.</p>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
    3x-2(\alert{-2x-3})\amp =-8\\
    3x+4x+6\amp = -8\\
    7x+6\amp = -8\\
    7x\amp = -14\\
    x\amp = -2
    \end{aligned}
    </me>

<p>Use this value to find the other coordinate. Substitute <m>x = -2</m> into either of the original equations or their equivalents. Typically, we use the equivalent equation that we found when isolating a variable in the first step.</p>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
    y\amp = -2x-3\\
    \amp = -2(\alert{-2})-3\\
    \amp = 4-3\\
    \amp =1
    \end{aligned}
    </me>

<p>Remember to present the solution as an ordered pair: <m>(-2,1)</m>. Verify that these coordinates solve both equations of the original system:

        We can solve for either variable in either equation. In this case, we will begin by solving for <m>x</m> in the first equation.

<p>Not all linear systems have only one ordered pair solution. Next, we will explore what happens when using the substitution method to solve a dependent system.</p>

<example><statement>

        Solve by substitution: <m>\begin{cases}

    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        We can solve for either variable in either equation. Since the first equation has a term with coefficient <m>1</m>, we choose to solve for that first.

        <mrow>10x-10x+2\amp = 2</mrow>
        <mrow>2\amp = 2</mrow>
    </md>

    <p>In this case, our variables cancelled and we ended up with a true statement. This means the equation is an identity and any real number is a solution. The solutions are of the form <m>(x,mx+b)</m>, and specifically in this case, our solutions are <m>(x,5x-1)</m>, where <m>x</m> is any real number.</p>


</solution>
</example>

<p>To have a better understanding of the previous example, rewrite both equations in slope-intercept (<m>y=mx+b</m>) form and graph them on the same set of axes.</p>

<p> <image source="images/Systems6.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

<p>We can see now that both equations represent the same line.</p>

<p>Now explore what happens when solving an inconsistent system using the substitution method.</p>


<example><statement>
    <p>
        Solve by substitution: <m>\begin{cases}
            -7x+3y\amp =3\\
            14x-6y\amp =-16
            \end{cases}</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        We will solve for <m>y</m> in the first equation.
    </p>

    <md>
        <mrow>-7x+3y\amp = 3</mrow>
        <mrow>3y\amp = 7x+3</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =\frac{7x+3}{3}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =\frac{7}{3}x+1</mrow>
    </md>

    <p>Substitute into the other equation:</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>14x-6y\amp =-16</mrow>
        <mrow>14x-6\left(\alert{\frac{7}{3}x+1}\right)\amp =-16</mrow>
        <mrow>14x-\frac{42}{3}x-6\amp = -16</mrow>
        <mrow>14x-14x-6\amp = -16</mrow>
        <mrow>-6\amp = -16</mrow>
    </md>

    <p>In this case, our variables cancelled and we ended up with a false statement. This means the equation is a contradiction. There is no solution for <m>x</m> and hence no solution to the system.</p>


</solution>
</example>

<p>A false statement indicates that the system is inconsistent, or in geometric terms, that the lines are parallel and do not intersect. To illustrate this, determine the slope-intercept form of each line and graph them on the same set of axes.</p>

<p> <image source="images/Systems7.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

<p>In slope-intercept form, it is easy to see that the two lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts.</p>


<example><statement>
    <p>
        Solve by substitution: <m>\begin{cases}
            2x-5y\amp =3\\
            4x-10y\amp =6
            \end{cases}</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>


    <p>The solutions are ordered pairs of the form <m>\left(x,\frac{2}{5}x-\frac{3}{5}\right)</m> where <m>x</m> is any real number.</p>

<subsection><title>The Elimination Method</title>
    <p>In this section, the goal is to learn another completely algebraic method for solving a system of linear equations called the <term>elimination method</term>. This method depends on the addition property of equations: given algebraic expressions <m>a, b, c</m>, and <m>d</m> we have</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>\text{if }a=b\text{ and }c=d,\text{ then }a+c=b+d.</mrow>
        </md>

    <p>Consider the following system:</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>
            \begin{aligned}
            x+y\amp =5\\
            x-y\amp =1
            \end{aligned}
        </mrow>
    </md>

    <p>We can add the equations together to eliminate the variable <m>y</m>.</p>

        <md>
            <mrow>
                \begin{aligned}
                x\alert{+y} \amp =5\\
                x\alert{-y}\amp =1\\
                \hline\\
                2x\amp =6
                \end{aligned}
            </mrow>
        </md>

<p>This leaves us with a linear equation with one variable that can be easily solved:</p>

<md>
    <mrow>
        \begin{aligned}
        2x\amp =6\\
        x\amp =3
        \end{aligned}
    </mrow>
</md>

<p>At this point, we have the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the simultaneous solution, so all that is left to do is to find the corresponding <m>y</m>-value. We can do this by back substituting <m>x=3</m> into one of the original equations:</p>

<md>
    <mrow>
        \begin{aligned}
        x+y\amp =5\\
        3+y\amp =5\\
        y\amp =2
        \end{aligned}
    </mrow>
</md>

<p>The solution to the system is <m>(3, 2)</m>. Of course, the variable is not always so easily eliminated. Typically, we have to find an equivalent system by applying the multiplication property of equality to one or both of the equations as a means to line up one of the variables to eliminate. The goal is to arrange so that either the <m>x</m> terms or the <m>y</m> terms are additive opposites, so that when the equations are added, the terms eliminate each other.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Solve by elimination: <m>\begin{cases}
            5x-3y\amp =-1\\
            3x+2y\amp =7
            \end{cases}</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        We choose to eliminate the terms with variable <m>y</m> because the coefficients have different signs. In order to get <m>3y</m> in the second equation we would have to multiply by <m>\frac{3}{2}</m>. If we instead wanted to multiply the first equation to have <m>-2y</m>, we would have to multiply it by <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, we can avoid using fractions at this step altogether. To do this, we first determine the least common multiple of the coefficients that we are trying to match; in this case, we are trying to eliminate the <m>y</m> variable so we compute <m>\text{LCM}(3, 2)</m>, which is <m>6</m>. Therefore, multiply both sides of both equations by the appropriate values to obtain coefficients of <m>-6</m> and <m>6</m>. This results in the following equivalent system:
    </p>

    <me>\begin{cases}
        (\alert{2})(5x-3y\amp =-1)\\
        (\alert{3})(3x+2y\amp =7)
        \end{cases}=
        \begin{cases}
        10x-6y\amp =-2\\
        9x+6y\amp =21
        \end{cases}</me>

<p>The terms involving <m>y</m> are now lined up to eliminate. We add the equations together and solve for <m>x</m>.</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>10x\alert{-6y}\amp = -2</mrow>
        <mrow>9x\alert{+6y}\amp = 21</mrow>
        <mrow>\hline</mrow>
        <mrow>19x\amp = 19</mrow>
    </md>

    <p>This gives us <m>x=1</m>. Now we substitute into either one of our beginning equations.</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>3x+2y\amp =7</mrow>
        <mrow>3(\alert{1})+2y\amp =7</mrow>

        <mrow>2y\amp = 4</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp = 2</mrow>
    </md>

    <p>This means our solution is <m>(1,2)</m>. We can check this as follows:</p>

<p>Sometimes linear systems are not given in standard form <m>ax+by=c</m>. When this is the case, it is best to rearrange the equations before beginning the steps to solve by elimination. Also, we can eliminate either variable. The goal is to obtain a solution for one of the variables and then back substitute to find a solution for the other.</p>

<subsection><title>Comparisons of the Solving Methods</title>

<p>We have reviewed three methods for solving linear systems of two equations with two variables. Each method is valid and can produce the same correct result. In this section, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each method.</p>

<p>The graphing method is useful for understanding what a system of equations is and what the solutions must look like. When the equations of a system are graphed on the same set of axes, we can see that the solution is the point where the graphs intersect. The graphing is made easy when the equations are in slope-intercept form. For example,</p>

<md>
    <mrow>
        \begin{aligned}
        y\amp =5x+15\\
        y\amp =-5x+5.
        \end{aligned}
    </mrow>
</md>

<p> <image source="images/Systems8.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

<p>The simultaneous solution <m>(-1, 10)</m> corresponds to the point of intersection. One drawback of this method is that it is very inaccurate. When the coordinates of the solution are not integers, the method is practically unusable. If we have a choice, we typically avoid this method in favor of the more accurate algebraic techniques.</p>

<p>The substitution method, on the other hand, is a completely algebraic method. It requires you to solve for one of the variables and substitute the result into the other equation. The resulting equation has one variable for which you can solve. This method is particularly useful when there is a variable within the system with coefficient of 1. For example,</p>

<md>
    <mrow>
        \begin{aligned}
        10x+y\amp =20\\
        7x+5y\amp =14
        \end{aligned}
    </mrow>
</md>

<p>In this case, it is easy to solve for <m>y</m> in the first equation and then substitute the result into the other equation. One drawback of this method is that it often leads to equivalent equations with fractional coefficients, which are tedious to work with. If there is not a coefficient of 1, then it usually is best to choose the elimination method.</p>

<p>The elimination method is a completely algebraic method which makes use of the addition property of equations. We multiply one or both of the equations to obtain equivalent equations where one of the variables is eliminated if we add them together. For example,</p>

<md>
    <mrow>
        \begin{aligned}
        2x-3y\amp =9\\
        5x-8y\amp =-16
        \end{aligned}
    </mrow>
</md>

<p>To eliminate the terms involving <m>x</m>, we would multiply both sides of the first equation by 5 and both sides of the second equation by <m>-2</m>. This results in an equivalent system where the variable <m>x</m> is eliminated when we add the equations together. Of course, there are other combinations of numbers that achieve the same result. We could even choose to eliminate the variable <m>y</m>. No matter which variable is eliminated first, the solution will be the same. Note that the substitution method, in this case, would require tedious calculations with fractional coefficients. One weakness of the elimination method, as we will see later in our study of algebra, is that it does not always work for nonlinear systems.</p>

<section  xml:id="Applications-of-Systems"><title>Applications of Systems of Linear Equations</title>
<introduction>
<p>If we translate an application to a mathematical setup using two variables, then we need to form a linear system with two equations. Setting up word problems with two variables often simplifies the entire process, particularly when the relationships between the variables are not so clear.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        The sum of <m>4</m> times a larger integer and <m>5</m> times a smaller integer is <m>7</m>. When twice the smaller integer is subtracted from <m>3</m> times the larger, the result is <m>11</m>. Find the integers.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>Begin by assigning variables to the larger and smaller integer.</p>

    <p>Let <m>x</m> represent the larger integer, and let <m>y</m> represent the smaller integer.</p>

    <p>When using two variables, we need to set up two equations. The first sentence describes a sum and the second sentence describes a difference. The phrase "<m>4</m> times a larger integer" translates to the expression <m>4x</m>, and "<m>5</m> times a smaller integer" translates to <m>5y</m>. Altogether, we get <m>4x+5y=7</m> for the first equation. Likewise, we get <m>3x-2y=11</m> for the second equation. This leads to the following system:</p>

    <me>\begin{cases}
            4x+5y\amp =7\\
            3x-2y\amp =11
            \end{cases}</me>.
     <p>We will solve this using the elimination method. To eliminate the variable <m>y</m> multiply the first equation by <m>2</m> and the second by <m>5</m>.</p>

    <me>\begin{cases}
        (\alert{2})\amp (4x\amp +5y\amp =7)\\
        (\alert{5})\amp 3 x\amp -2y\amp =11)\\
        \end{cases}=
        \begin{cases}
        8x+10y\amp =14\\
        15x-10y\amp =55
        \end{cases}</me>

    <p>Next we add the equations in the equivalent system and solve for <m>x</m>.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        8x \amp\, \alert{+10y}\amp =14\\
        15x\amp\, \alert{-10y}\amp =55\\
        \hline\\
        23x\amp\amp =69
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>This gives <m>x=\frac{69}{23}=3</m>. Now we use this for a substitution into an original equation to find <m>y</m>.</p>
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        4x+5y\amp =7\\
        4(\alert{3})+5y\amp =7\\
        12+5y\amp =7\\
        5y\amp = -5\\
        y\amp =-1
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p> The larger integer is <m>3</m> and the smaller integer is <m>-1</m>.</p>


</solution>
</example>

<exercise><statement>
    <p>
        An integer is <m>1</m> less than twice that of another. If their sum is <m>20</m>, find the integers.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>The two integers are <m>7</m> and <m>13</m>.</p>
    </solution>
    </exercise>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        A total of <m>$12,800</m> was invested in two accounts. Part was invested in a CD at a <m>3.125</m>%
        annual interest rate and part was invested in a money market fund at a <m>4.75</m>% annual interest rate. If the total simple interest for one year was <m>$465</m>, then how much was invested in each account?
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>We begin by identifying two variables: let <m>x</m> represent the amount invested at <m>3.125</m>%=<m>0.03125</m>, and let <m>y</m> represent the amount invested at <m>4.75</m>%=<m>0.0475</m>.</p>

    <p>The total amount in both accounts can be expressed as</p>

    <me>x+y=12,800</me>

    <p>To set up a second equation, use the fact that the total interest was <m>$465</m>. The interest for one year is the interest rate times the principal (<m>I=prt=pr⋅1=pr</m>). Use this to add the interest in both accounts. Be sure to use the decimal equivalents for the interest rates given as percentages.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        \text{interest from the CD }\, \amp + \, \text{interest from the fund } \amp =\amp \text{total interest}\\
        0.03125x \amp + 0.0475y \amp = \amp 465
        \end{aligned}</me>

    <p>These two equations together form the following linear system:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{cases}
         x\amp +y\amp =12,800\\
         0.03125x \amp + 0.0475y \amp = 465
        \end{cases}
    </me>

    <p>Eliminate <m>x</m> by multiplying the first equation by <m>-0.03125</m>.</p>

   <me>\begin{cases}
       (\alert{-0.03125})\amp ( x\amp +y\amp =12,800)\\
      \amp 0.03125x \amp + 0.0475y \amp = 465\\
       \end{cases}\\=
       \begin{cases}
       -0.03125x\amp -0.03125y\amp = -400\\
       0.03125x \amp + 0.0475y \amp = 465
       \end{cases}</me>

   <p>Next, we add the equations together.</p>

   <me>
       \begin{aligned}
       \alert{-0.03125x}\amp -0.03125y\amp = -400\\
       \alert{0.03125x} \amp + 0.0475y \amp = 465\\
       \hline\\
       \amp \, 0.01625y\amp=65
       \end{aligned}
       </me>

   <p>This gives <m>y=\frac{65}{0.01625}=4,000</m>. We use this for a substitution to find <m>x</m>.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        x+y\amp = 12,800\\
        x+4,000\amp = 12,800\\
        x\amp =8,800
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p> Of the money invested, <m>$4,000</m> was invested at <m>4.75</m>% and <m>$8,800</m> was invested at <m>3.125</m>%.</p>


</solution>
</example>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        A jar consisting of only nickels and dimes contains <m>58</m> coins. If the total value is <m>$4.20</m>, how many of each coin is in the jar?
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>We begin by identifying two variables: let <m>n</m> represent the <em>number</em> of nickels in the jar and let <m>d</m> represent the <em>number</em> of dimes in the jar.</p>

    <p>The total number of coins in the jar can be expressed as</p>

    <me>n+d=58</me>

    <p>Next, we use the value of each coin to determine the total value <m>$4.20</m>. A nickel is worth <m>$0.05</m> and a dime is worth <m>$0.10</m>. So, when we multiply <m>0.05</m> by the number of nickels <m>n</m>, we will get the value of all our nickels combined, and likewise with the dimes. Together, the value of the nickels added together with the value of the dimes will give us the total value:</p>

    <me>0.05n+0.10d=4.20</me>

    <p>This leads us to following linear system:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{cases}
        n\amp +d\amp =58\\
        0.05n \amp + 0.10d\amp = 4.20
        \end{cases}
    </me>

    <p>Here we will solve using the substitution method. In the first equation, we can solve for <m>n</m>.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        n+d\amp =58\\
        n\amp = 58-d
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

   <p> Now we will substitute <m>n=58-d</m> into the second equation and solve for <m>d</m>.
       </p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        0.05(\alert{58-d})+0.10d\amp =4.20\\
        2.9-0.05d+0.10d\amp = 4.20\\
        2.9+0.05d\amp =4.20\\
        0.05d\amp = 1.3\\
        d\amp =26
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>Now we use this for a substitution to find the number of nickels.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        n\amp = 58-d\\
        \amp= 58-26\\
        \amp = 32
        \end{aligned}

</introduction>
<subsection><title>Mixture Applications</title>

<p>Mixture problems often include a percentage and some total amount. It is important to make a distinction between these two types of quantities. For example, if a problem states that a 20-ounce container is filled with a <m>2</m>% saline (salt) solution, then this means that the container is filled with a mixture of salt and water as follows:</p>

<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
        <row bottom="minor">
                <cell><m></m></cell>
                <cell><m>Percentage</m></cell>
                <cell><m>Amount</m></cell>
            </row>
        <row>
                <cell><m>Salt</m></cell>
                <cell><m>2</m>%<m>=0.02</m></cell>
                <cell><m>0.02</m> (<m>20</m> ounces)<m>=0.4</m> ounces</cell>
            </row>
        <row>
                 <cell><m>Water</m></cell>
                <cell><m>98</m>%<m>=0.98</m></cell>
                <cell><m>0.98</m> (<m>20</m> ounces)<m>=19.6</m> ounces</cell>
            </row>
</tabular></sidebyside>


<p>In other words, we multiply the percentage times the total to get the amount of each part of the mixture.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        A <m>1.8</m>% saline solution is to be combined and mixed with a <m>3.2</m>% saline solution to produce <m>35</m> ounces of a <m>2.2</m>% saline solution. How much of each is needed?
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>We begin by identifying two variables: let <m>x</m> represent the volume in ounces of <m>1.8</m>% saline solution needed and let <m>y</m> represent the volume in ounces of <m>3.2</m>% saline solution needed.</p>

    <p>The total amount of saline solution needed is <m>35</m> ounces. This leads to one equation:</p>

    <me>x+y=35</me>

    <p>The second equation adds up the amount of salt in the correct percentages. The amount of salt is obtained by multiplying the percentage times the amount, where the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> represent the amounts of the solutions. The amount of salt in the end solution is <m>2.2</m>% of the <m>35</m> ounces, or <m>0.022(35)</m>.</p>

    <me>0.018x+0.032y=0.022(35)</me>

    <p>This leads us to the following linear system:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{cases}
        x\amp +y\amp =35\\
        0.018x \amp + 0.032y\amp = 0.022(35)
        \end{cases}
    </me>

    <p>Here we will solve using the elimination method. </p>

    <me>\begin{cases}
        (\alert{-0.018})\amp(x\amp +y\amp =35)\\
        \amp 0.018x \amp + 0.032y\amp = 0.022(35)
        \end{cases}\\
        =\begin{cases}
        -0.018x\amp -0.018y\amp =-0.63\\
        0.018x \amp + 0.032y\amp = 0.022(35)
        \end{cases}
    </me>

<p>    Now we add the resulting equations together.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        \alert{-0.018x}\amp -0.018y\amp =-0.63\\
        \alert{0.018x} \amp + 0.032y\amp = 0.022(35)\\

        An <m>80</m>% antifreeze concentrate is to be mixed with water to produce a <m>48</m>-liter mixture containing <m>25</m>% antifreeze. How much water and antifreeze concentrate is needed?
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>We begin by identifying two variables: let <m>x</m> represent the volume in liters of <m>80</m>% antifreeze concentrate needed and let <m>y</m> represent the volume in liters of water needed.</p>

    <p>The total amount of the mixture needed is <m>48</m> liters. This leads to the equation</p>

    <me>x+y=48.</me>

    <p>The second equation adds up the amount of antifreeze from each solution in the correct percentages. The amount of antifreeze in the end result is <m>25</m>% of the <m>48</m> liters, or <m>0.25(48)</m>.</p>

    <me>0.80x+0\cdot y=0.25(48)</me>

    <p>This leads us to the following linear system:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{cases}
        x\amp +y\amp =48\\
        0.80x \amp +\amp = 0.25(48)=12
        \end{cases}
    </me>

    <p>We will use the second equation to find <m>x</m>: </p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        0.80x\amp =12\\
        x\amp =\frac{12}{0.80}\\
        x\amp =15
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Now we use this for a substitution to find the value of <m>y</m>.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        x+y\amp = 48\\
        \alert{15}+y\amp =48\\
        y\amp =33
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p> We need to mix <m>33</m> liters of water with <m>15</m> liters of antifreeze concentrate.</p>

<subsection><title>Distance Applications</title>

<p>Distance traveled is equal to the average rate times the time traveled at that rate, <m>d=r\cdot t</m>. These uniform motion problems usually have a lot of data, so it helps to first organize that data in a chart and then set up a linear system. In this section, you are encouraged to use two variables.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Naomi traveled a total of <m>4</m> hours and <m>875</m> miles by car and by plane. Driving to the airport by car, she averaged <m>50</m> miles per hour. In the air, the plane averaged <m>320</m> miles per hour. How long did it take her to drive to the airport?
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>We are asked to find the time it takes her to drive to the airport; this indicates that time is the unknown quantity.</p>

    <p>We begin by identifying two variables: let <m>x</m> represent the time (in hours) it took to drive to the airport and let <m>y</m> represent the time (in hours) spent in the air.</p>

    <p>Since the total time traveled was <m>4</m> hours, we have our first equation</p>

    <me>x+y=4.</me>

    <p>We use the formula <m>d=r\cdot t</m> to fill in the unknown distances:</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>\text{Distance traveled in the car: }\, d=r\cdot t=50\cdot x</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{Distance traveled in the air: }\, d=r\cdot t=320\cdot y</mrow>
    </md>

    <p>The total amount of miles traveled is 875, so this leads to the equation</p>

    <me>50x+320y=875.</me>

    <p>This leads us to the following linear system:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{cases}
        x\amp +y\amp =4\\
        50x \amp +320y\amp = 875
        \end{cases}
    </me>

    <p>We will solve using the elimination method.</p>

    <me>\begin{cases}
        (\alert{-50})\amp(x\amp +y\amp =4)\\
        \amp 50x \amp +320y\amp = 875
        \end{cases}\\
        =
        \begin{cases}
        \amp -50x\amp -50y\amp =-200\\
        \amp 50x \amp +320y\amp = 875
        \end{cases}
    </me>

    <p>Now we add the resulting equations together.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        \alert{-50x}\amp -50y =-200\\
        \alert{50x} \amp +320y= 875\\
        \hline\\
        \amp \, 270 y = 675
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>This results in <m>y=\frac{675}{270}=\frac{5}{2}</m>. Now we substitute to find the time <m>x</m> it took to drive to the airport:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        x+y\amp =4\\
        x+\alert{\frac{5}{2}}\amp =4\\
        x\amp = \frac{8}{2}-\frac{5}{2}\\
        x\amp =\frac{3}{2}
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p> It took Naomi <m>1.5</m> hours to drive to the airport.</p>

</solution>
</example>

<p>It is not always the case that time is the unknown quantity. Read the problem carefully and identify what you are asked to find. This defines your variables.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Flying with the wind, Dale piloted a light aircraft traveling <m>240</m> miles in <m>2</m> hours. Dale then turned against the wind and traveled another <m>135</m> miles in <m>1.5</m> hours. Find the speed of the airplane and the speed of the wind (you may assume that Dale flew at a constant rate and the wind blew at a constant rate.).
    </p></statement>
<solution>

    <p>We begin by identifying two variables: let <m>a</m> represent the speed of the airplane in miles per hour and let <m>w</m> represent the speed of the wind in miles per hour.</p>

    <p>With the wind, the airplane's total speed is <m>a+w</m>. Flying against the wind, the total speed is <m>a-w</m>.</p>

    <p>We use the formula <m>d=r\cdot t</m> to find the unknown distances. Be careful when grouping the quantities that represent the rate in parentheses:</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>\text{Flight with wind: }\, d=r\cdot t\implies 240=(a+w)\cdot 2</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{Flight against wind: }\, d=r\cdot t\implies 135=(a-w)\cdot 1.5</mrow>
    </md>

    <p>If we divide both sides of the first equation by <m>2</m> (or multiply by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>) and both sides of the second equation by <m>1.5=\frac{3}{2}</m> (or multiply by the reciprocal <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>), then we obtain the following equivalent system:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{cases}
        \left(\alert{\frac{1}{2}}\right)(240=(a+w)\cdot 2)\\
        \left(\alert{\frac{2}{3}}\right)\left(135=(a-w)\cdot\frac{3}{2}\right)\\
        \end{cases}
        =
        \begin{cases}
        120=a+w\\
        90=a-w\\
        \end{cases}
    </me>

    <p>Here <m>w</m> is lined up to eliminate.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        a\alert{+w}\amp =120\\
        a \alert{-w}\amp =90\\
        \hline\\
        2a\amp = 210
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>This results in <m>a=\frac{210}{2}=105</m>. Now we substitute to find the speed <m>w</m> of the wind:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        a+w\amp = 120\\
        \alert{105}+w\amp =120\\
        w\amp =15
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p> Dale piloted his airplane at a speed of <m>105</m> miles per hour and the speed of the wind is <m>15</m> miles per hour.</p>
