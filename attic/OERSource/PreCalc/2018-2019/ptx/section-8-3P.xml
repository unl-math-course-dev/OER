<title>Long-Run Behavior of Rational Functions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	A rational function is the quotient of two polynomials. (As with rational numbers, the word <em>rational   </em> refers to a ratio.)
</p>

<assemblage><title>Rational Functions</title>
    <p>
        A <term> rational function</term> is one of the form
        <me> f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}</me>
        where <m> P(x)</m> and <m> Q(x)</m> are polynomials and <m> Q(x)\neq 0</m>.
        </p>
    </assemblage>

<p>
	The graphs of rational functions can be quite different from the graphs of polynomials.

		Queueing theory is used to predict your waiting time in a line, or queue. For example, suppose the attendant at a toll booth can process <m>6</m> vehicles per minute. The average total time spent by a motorist negotiating the toll booth depends on the rate, <m>r</m>, at which vehicles arrive, according to the formula
		<me>
			T=g(r)=\frac{12-r}{12(6-r)}.

		EarthCare decides to sell T-shirts to raise money. The company makes an initial investment of $100 to pay for the design of the T-shirt and to set up the printing process. After that, the T-shirts cost $5 each for labor and materials.

				<p>If EarthCare makes only one T-shirt, its cost is $105. But if more than one T-shirt is made, the cost of the original $100 investment is distributed among them. For example, the average cost per T-shirt for <m>\alert{2}</m> T-shirts is
				<me>
					\frac{100 + 5(\alert{2})}{\alert{2}}=55
				</me>
				and the average cost for <m>\alert{5}</m> T-shirts is
				<me>
					\frac{100 + 5(\alert{5})}{\alert{5}}=25.
				</me>

				The graph shows that as the number of T-shirts increases, the average cost per shirt continues to decrease, but not as rapidly as at first. Eventually the average cost levels off and approaches $5 per T-shirt. For example, if EarthCare produces <m>\alert{400}</m> T-shirts, the average cost per shirt is 
				<me>
					\frac{100+5(\alert{400})}{\alert{400}}=5.25.

	The horizontal line <m>C = 5</m> on the graph of <m>C = \displaystyle{\frac{100 + 5x}{x}}</m> is a <term>horizontal asymptote</term><idx>horizontal asymptote</idx>. As <m>x</m> increases, the graph approaches the line <m>C = 5</m>. The average price per T-shirt will always be slightly more than <dollar/>5. Horizontal asymptotes are also important in sketching the graphs of rational functions.

<subsection><title>Long Run Behavior for Rational Functions</title>
<p>
   Recall in the start of this chapter we discussed the long run behavior of polynomial functions. Recall too that given a polynomial
   <me> f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots + a_1x+a_0 </me>
   the leading term of <m> f(x) </m> is the term <m> a_nx^n </m>.
</p>


<assemblage><title> Long Run Behavior </title>
    <p>
        Suppose that <m> f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}</m> is a rational function. Let <m> ax^n</m> be the leading term of <m> P(x)</m> and <m> bx^m </m> be the leading term of <m> Q(x)</m>. Then the long run behavior of <m> f(x)</m> is the same as the long run behavior of the power function
        <me> \frac{ax^n}{bx^m}=\frac{a}{b}x^{n-m}.</me>
        </p>
</assemblage>


  <p>  If the resulting power function happens to be a constant function (so <m> n=m</m> above) then the rational function has a <em> horizontal asymptote</em> at <m>y=\frac{a}{b}</m>.
      </p>
  
  
<example><statement>
<p>
    Identify the long run behavior of the rational function
    <me>
        f(x)=\frac{-2x^7+4x^2-1}{x^3+8x}.
        </me>
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
    First, we note that the leading term of the numerator is <m> -2x^7</m> and the leading term of the denominator is <m> x^3</m>. So, the long run behavior of <m> f </m> is given by
    <me> \frac{-2x^7}{x^3}=-2x^4. </me>
    We know that the long run behavior of <m> x^4</m> is
    <me> x^4\to \infty\ \text{as}\ x\to\pm\infty. </me>
    Since the graph of <m> -2x^4</m> is the graph of <m> x^4 </m> stretched vertically by a factor of <m>2</m> and then reflected about the <m> x</m>-axis, get that the long run behavior of <m> -2x^4</m> is
      <me> -2x^4\to -\infty\ \text{as}\ x\to\pm\infty. </me>
      Thus, the long run behavior of <m> f(x) </m> is
        <me> f(x)\to -\infty\ \text{as}\ x\to\pm\infty. </me>
</p>
</solution>
