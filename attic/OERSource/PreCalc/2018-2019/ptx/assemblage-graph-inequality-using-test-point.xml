    <title>To Graph an Inequality Using a Test Point:</title>
    <p>
		<ol label="1">
			<li><p>
				Graph the corresponding equation to obtain the boundary line.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Choose a test point that does not lie on the boundary line.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality.
				<ol label="a">
					<li><p>
						If the resulting statement is true, shade the half-plane that includes the test point.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						If the resulting statement is false, shade the half-plane that does not include the test point.
					</p></li>
				</ol>

					If the inequality is strict, make the boundary line a dashed line.
