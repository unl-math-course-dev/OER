<project><title>Wien's Law</title><p>
A hot object such as a light bulb or a star radiates energy over a range of wavelengths, but the wavelength with maximum energy is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. If temperature is measured in
kelvins, and wavelength in micrometers, the constant of proportionality is <m>2898</m>. (One micrometer is one
thousandth of a millimeter, or <m>1 \mu m = 10^{-6}</m> meter.)
<ol label="a">
    <li><p>Write a formula for the wavelength of maximum energy, <m>\lambda_{\text{max}}</m>, as a function of temperature, <m>T</m>. This formula, called Wien's law, was discovered in 1894.</p></li>
    <li><p>Our sun's temperature is about <m>5765</m> K. At what wavelength is most of its energy radiated?</p></li>
    <li><p>The color of light depends on its wavelength, as shown in the table. Can you explain why the sun does not appear to be green? Use Wien's law to describe how the color of a star depends on its temperature.</p><p>

<project><title>Halley's Comet</title><p>
Halley's comet which orbits the sun every <m>76</m> years, was first observed in 240 B.C. Its orbit is highly elliptical, so that its closest approach to the Sun (<term>perihelion</term><idx>perihelion</idx>) is only <m>0.587</m> AU, while at its greatest distance (<term>aphelion</term><idx>aphelion</idx>) the comet is <m>34.39</m> AU from the Sun. (An AU, or astronomical unit, is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, <m>1.5\times 10^8</m> kilometers.)
<ol label="a">
    <li><p>Calculate the distances in meters from the Sun to Halley's comet at perihelion and aphelion.</p></li>
    <li><p>Halley's comet has a volume of <m>700</m> cubic kilometers, and its density is about <m>0.1</m> gram per cubic centimeter. Calculate the mass of the comet in kilograms.</p></li>
    <li><p>The gravitational force (in newtons) exerted by the Sun on its satellites is inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the satellite in meters.

<project><title>Naismith's Number</title><p>
    Fell running is a popular sport in the hills, or fells, of the British Isles. Fell running records depend on the altitude gain over the course of the race as well as its length. The equivalent horizontal distance for a race of length <m>x</m> kilometers with an ascent of <m>y</m> kilometers is given by <m>x + Ny</m>, where <m>N</m> is Naismith's number (see <xref ref="Naismith" text="type-global"/>). The record times for women's races are approximated in minutes by <m>t = 2.43(x + 9.5y)^{1.15}</m>, and men's times by <m>t = 2.18(x + 8.0y)^{1.14}</m>. (Source: Scarf, 1998)

<project><title>Elasticity</title><p>
    Elasticity is the property of an object that causes it to regain its original shape after being compressed or deformed. One measure of elasticity considers how high the object bounces when dropped onto a hard surface,

<project><title>Mersenne's Laws</title><p>
    The tone produced by a vibrating string depends on the frequency of the vibration. The frequency in turn depends on the length of the string, its weight, and its tension. In 1636, Marin Mersenne quantified these relationships as follows. The frequency, <m>f</m>, of the vibration is
    <ol label="i">
        <li><p>inversely proportional to the string's length, <m>L</m>,</p></li>
        <li><p>directly proportional to the square root of the string's tension, <m>T</m>, and</p></li>
        <li><p>inversely proportional to the square root of the string's weight per unit length, <m>w</m>. (Source: Berg and Stork, 1982)</p></li>
    </ol>
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>Write a formula for <m>f</m> that summarizes Mersenne's laws.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sketch a graph of <m>f</m> as a function of <m>L</m>, assuming that <m>T</m> and <m>w</m> are constant. (You do not have enough information to put scales on the axes, but you can show the shape of the graph.)</p></li>
        <li><p>On a piano, the frequency of the highest note is about <m>4200</m> hertz. This frequency is <m>150</m> times the frequency of the lowest note, at about <m>28</m> hertz.

<project><title>Damuth's Formula</title><p>
    In 1981, John Damuth collected data on the average body mass, <m>m</m>, and the average population density, <m>D</m>, for 307 species of herbivores. He found that, very roughly, <me>D = km^{-0.75}</me>

<project><title>Self-thinning Law</title><p>
    Studies on pine plantations in the 1930s showed that as the trees grow and compete for space, some of the die, so that the density of trees per unit area decreases. The average mass of an individual tree is a power function of the density, <m>d</m>, of the trees per unit area, given by 
    <me>M(d) = kd^{-1.5}</me>
    This formula is known as the <m>\dfrac{-3}{2}</m> <term>self-thinning law</term>. (Source: Chapman and Reiss, 1992)
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>To simplify the calculations, suppose that a pine tree is shaped like a tall circular cone and that as it grows, its height is always a constant multiple of its base radius, <m>r</m>. Explain why the base radius of the tree is proportional to the square root of the area the tree covers. Write <m>r</m> as a power function of <m>d</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Write a formula for the volume of the tree in terms of its base radius, <m>r</m>. Use part (b) to write the volume as a power function of <m>d</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>The mass (or weight) of a pine tree is roughly proportional to its volume, and the area taken up by a single tree is inversely proportional to the plant density, <m>d</m>. Use these facts to justify the self-thinning law.</p></li>
