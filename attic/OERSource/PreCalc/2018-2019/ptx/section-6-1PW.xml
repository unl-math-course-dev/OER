<title>Intro to Quadratic Functions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	Perhaps you have previously recognized the graph of the baseball's height as a parabola. In this chapter, we shall see that the graph of any quadratic function is a parabola.
</p>
<xi:include href="./assemblage-quadratic-function.xml" />
<p>
	In the definition above, notice that if <m>a</m> is zero, there is no <m>x</m>-squared term, so the function is not quadratic.
</p>
<p>
	The height of a baseball <m>t</m> seconds after being hit was given by
	<me>h = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
	We used a graph to find two times when the baseball was <m>64</m> feet high. Can we solve the same problem algebraically?
</p>
<p>
	We are looking for values of <m>t</m> that produce <m>h = 64</m> in the height equation. So, if we substitute <m>h = 64</m> into the height equation, we would like to solve the <term>quadratic equation</term>
	<me>64 = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
	This equation cannot be solved by extraction of roots, because there are two terms containing the variable <m>t</m>, and they cannot be combined. To solve this equation, we will appeal to a property of our number system, called the <term>zero-factor principle</term>.
</p>
</introduction>


<subsection><title>Zero-Factor Principle</title>
<p>
	Can you multiply two numbers together and obtain a product of zero? Only if one of the two numbers happens to be zero. This property of numbers is called the <term>zero-factor principle</term>.
</p>
<xi:include href="./assemblage-zero-factor-principle.xml" />
<p>
	The principle is true even if the numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are represented by algebraic expressions, such as <m>x - 5</m> or <m>2x + 1</m>. For example, if
	<me>(x - 5)(2x + 1) = 0</me>
	then it must be true that either <m>x - 5 = 0</m> or <m>2x + 1 = 0</m>. Thus, we can use the zero-factor principle to solve equations.

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring</title>
<p>
	Before we apply the zero-factor principle to solve a quadratic equation, we must first write the equation so that one side of the equation is zero. Let us introduce some terminology.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Forms for Quadratic Equations</title>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			 A quadratic equation written
			 <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me>
			 is in <term>standard form</term><idx>standard form</idx>.
		</li>
		<li>
			A quadratic equation written 
			<me>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</me>
			 is in <term>factored form</term><idx>factored form</idx>.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p></assemblage>

<p>
	Once we have written the equation in standard form, we factor the left side and set each variable factor equal to zero separately.
</p>

<exercise xml:id="example-quadratic-via-factoring">
 <webwork>
<setup>
<pg-code>
$d=-1;
$c=2/3;
</pg-code>
</setup>
 <statement>
	<p>
		Solve <m>3x(x + 1) = 2x + 2</m>.
	</p>
	
			<p>The smaller value of <m>x</m> is <var name="$d" width="2" /></p>
			
			<p>The larger value of <m>x</m> is <var name="$c" width="2" /></p>
</statement>

<solution>
	<p>
		First, we write the equation in standard form.
		\begin{align*}
		3x(x + 1) \amp = 2x + 2\amp\amp\text{Apply the distributive law to the left side.}\\
		3x^2 + 3x \amp = 2x + 2\amp\amp\text{Subtract }2x + 2 \text{ from both sides.}\\
		3x^2 + x - 2 \amp = 0
		\end{align*}
		Next, we factor the left side to obtain
		<me>(3x - 2)(x + 1) = 0</me>
		We then apply the zero-factor principle by setting each factor equal to zero.
		<me>3x - 2 =0 ~~\text{ or }~~ x + 1 = 0</me>
		Finally, we solve each equation to find
		<me>x = \frac{2}{3} ~~\text{ or }~~ x = -1</me>
		The solutions are <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> and <m>-1</m>.
	</p>
</solution>
</webwork>
</exercise>

<warning><title></title><p>
	When we apply the zero-factor principle, one side of the equation must be zero. For example, to solve the equation
	<me>(x - 2)(x - 4) = 15</me>
	it is incorrect to set each factor equal to <m>15</m>! (There are many ways that the product of two numbers can equal <m>15</m>; it is not necessary that one of the numbers be <m>15</m>.) We must first simplify the left side and write the equation in standard form. (The correct solutions are <m>7</m> and <m>-1</m>; make sure you can find these solutions.)
</p></warning>

<p>
	We summarize the factoring method for solving quadratic equations as follows.

	We can use factoring to solve the equation from <xref ref="investigation-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>.
</p>

 <statement>
	<p>
		The height, <m>h</m>, of a baseball <m>t</m> seconds after being hit is given by
		<me>h = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
		When will the baseball reach a height of <m>64</m> feet?
	</p>
	
				<p>The smaller value of <m>t</m> is <var name="$d" width="2" /></p>
			
			<p>The larger value of <m>t</m> is <var name="$c" width="2" /></p>
	
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		We substitute <m>64</m> for <m>h</m> in the formula, and solve for <m>t</m>.
		\begin{align*}
		64 = -16t^2 + 64t \amp + 4\amp\amp\text{Write the equation in standard form.}\\
		16t^2 - 64t + 60 \amp= 0\amp\amp\text{Factor 4 from the left side.}\\
		4(4t^2 - 16t + 15) \amp= 0\amp\amp\text{Factor the quadratic expression.}\\

		t = \frac{3}{2}  ~~\text{ or }~~  t \amp = \frac{5}{2}
		\end{align*}
		There are two solutions to the quadratic equation. At <m>t = \dfrac{3}{2}</m> seconds, the ball reaches a height of <m>64</m> feet on the way up, and at <m>t = \dfrac{5}{2}</m> seconds, the ball is <m>64</m> feet high on its way down.

</exercise>

<note><p>
	In the solution to <xref ref="example-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>, the factor <m>4</m> does not affect the solutions of the equation at all. You can understand why this is true by looking at some graphs. First, check that the two equations
	<me>x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 ~~\text{ and }~~ 4(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0</me>
	have the same solutions, <m>x = 1</m> and <m>x = 3</m>. Then use your graphing calculator to graph the equation
	<me>Y_1 = X^2 - 4X + 3</me>
	in the window
	    \begin{align}
        \text{Xmin} \amp = -2 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 8\\
        \text{Ymin} \amp = -5 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 10
        \end{align}
       Notice that when <m>y = 0</m>, <m>x = 3</m> or <m>x = 1</m>. These two points are the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph. In the same window, now graph
       <me>Y_2 = 4(X^2 - 4X + 3)</me>
       (See <xref ref="fig-GC-scaled-parabola" text="type-global"/>.) This graph has the same <m>x</m>-values when <m>y = 0</m>. The factor of <m>4</m> stretches the graph vertically but does not change the location of the <m>x</m>-intercepts. The value of the constant factor <m>a</m> in the factored form of a quadratic function, <m>f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)</m>, does not affect the location of the <m>x</m>-intercepts, because it does not affect the solutions of the equation <m>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</m>.</p>

			<p>The length is <var name="$d" width="2" /> inches</p>

		</tabular></sidebyside>
		<p>We can use the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation.

		Because the width of the screen cannot be a negative number, we discard the solution <m>w = -12</m>. Thus, the width is <m>w = 9</m> inches, and the length is <m>w + 3 = 12</m> inches.

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square</title><idx>completing the square</idx>
    <p>
        Now we will use completing the square to solve quadratic equations. First, we will solve equations in which the coefficient of the squared term is 1. Consider the equation
        <me>x^2 - 6x - 7 = 0</me>
        and follow the steps to find the solutions.
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Begin by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation, to get</p>
            <sidebyside><tabular><row><cell><m>x^2 - 6x{}<fillin characters="6"/> = 7</m></cell></row></tabular></sidebyside>
            </li>
            <li>
                Now complete the square on the left. Because
                <me>p = \frac{1}{2}(-6) = -3 ~~~\text{ and } ~~~ p^2 = (-3)^2 = 9</me>
                we add <m>9</m> to <em>both</em> sides of our equation to get
                <me>x^2 - 6x \alert{{}+9}=7\alert{{}+9}</me>
            </li>
            <li>
                The left side of the equation is now the square of a binomial, namely <m>(x - 3)^2</m>. We write the left side in its square form and simplify the right side, which gives us
                <me>(x - 3)^2 =16</me>
                (You can check that this equation is equivalent to the original one; if you expand the left side and collect like terms, you will return to the original equation.)
            </li>
            <li>
                We can now use extraction of roots to find the solutions. Taking square roots of both sides, we get
                \begin{align*}
                x - 3 \amp =4 \amp\text{or}\amp\amp x - 3 \amp= -4\amp\text{Solve each equation.}\\
                x \amp =7 \amp\text{or}\amp\amp x \amp= -1
                \end{align*}
                The solutions are <m>7</m> and <m>-1</m>.
            </li>

        </p><p>
            We can also solve <m>x^2 - 6x - 7 = 0</m> by factoring instead of completing the square. Of course, we get the same solutions by either method. In Example 2, we will solve an equation that cannot be solved by factoring.

<subsection><title>The General Case</title>
    <p>
        Our method for completing the square works only if the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is <m>1</m>. If we want to solve a quadratic equation whose lead coefficient is not <m>1</m>, we first divide each term of the equation by the lead coefficient.
    </p>
    
    <example xml:id="example-general-quadratic">

 <statement>
        <p>
            Solve <m>2x^2 - 6x - 5 = 0</m>.
        </p>
    </statement><solution>
        <p><ol label="1">
            <li>
                <p>Because the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is <m>2</m>, we must divide each term of the equation by <m>2</m>.
                    <me>x^2 - 3x - \frac{5}{2}= 0</me>
                    Now we proceed as before. Rewrite the equation with the constant on the right side.
                    <me>x^2 - 3x ~<fillin characters="6" /> = \frac{5}{2}</me></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complete the square:
                    <me>p = \frac{1}{2}(-3) = \frac{-3}{2} ~~~\text{ and } ~~~ p^2 = \left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}</me>
                    Add <m>\frac{9}{4}</m> to both sides of our equation:
                    <me>x^2 - 3x  \alert{{}+\frac{9}{4}}=\frac{5}{2}\alert{{}+\frac{9}{4}}</me></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rewrite the left side as the square of a binomial and simplify the right side to get
                    <me>\left(x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 =\frac{19}{4}</me></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Finally, extract roots and solve each equation for <m>x</m>.
                    <me>
                        x - \frac{3}{2}  =\sqrt{\frac{19}{4}} ~~~\text{ or }~~~ x - \frac{3}{2} = -\sqrt{\frac{19}{4}}
                    </me>
                    The solutions are <m>\dfrac{3}{2}+\sqrt{\dfrac{19}{4}}</m> and <m>\dfrac{3}{2}-\sqrt{\dfrac{19}{4}}</m>. Using a calculator, we can find decimal approximations for the solutions: <m>3.679</m> and <m>-0.679</m>.</p>

        <p>
            In <xref ref="example-completing-the-square2" text="type-global"/>, it is essential that we first divide each term of the equation by <m>2</m>, the coefficient of <m>x^2</m>. The following attempt at a solution is <em>incorrect</em>.
            \begin{align*}
            2x^2 - 6x \amp= 5\\
