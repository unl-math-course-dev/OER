<exercise number="14"><statement><p>
    Have you ever wondered why time seems to pass more quickly as we grow older? One theory suggests that the human mind judges the length of a long period of time by comparing it with its current age. For example, a year is <m>20\%</m> of a <m>5</m>-year-old's lifetime, but only <m>5\%</m> of a <m>20</m>-year-old's, so a year feels longer to a <m>5</m>-year-old. Thus, psychological time follows a log scale, like the one shown in the figure.</p>

        <li><p>Four years of college seems like a long time to an <m>18</m>-year-old. What length of time feels the same to a <m>40</m>-year-old?</p></li>
        <li><p>How long will the rest of your life feel? Let <m>A</m> be your current age, and let <m>L</m> be the age to which you think you will live. Compute the difference of their logs. Now move backward on the log scale an equal distance from your current age. What is the age at that spot? Call that age <m>B</m>. The rest of your life will feel the same as your life from age <m>B</m> until now.</p></li>
