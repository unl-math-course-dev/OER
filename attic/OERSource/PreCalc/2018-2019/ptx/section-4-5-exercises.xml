    Americium-241 (Am-241) is used in residential smoke detectors. Particles emitted as Am-241 decays cause the air in a smoke alarm to ionize, allowing current to flow between two electrodes. If smoke absorbs the particles, the current changes and sets off the alarm. The half-life of Am-241 is <m>432</m> years. How long will it take for <m>30\%</m> of the Am-241 to decay?</p></statement>

    Doctors can measure the amount of blood in a patient by injecting a known volume of red blood cells tagged with chromium-51. After allowing the blood to mix, they measure the percentage of tagged cells in a sample of the patient's blood and use a proportion to compute the original blood volume. Chromium-51 has a half-life of <m>27.7</m> days. How much of the original chromium-51 will still be present after <m>2</m> days?
