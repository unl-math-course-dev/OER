<exercise number="58"><statement><p>Two student pilots leave the airport at the same time. They both fly at an airspeed of <m>180</m> miles per hour, but one flies with the wind and the other flies against the
wind.
<ol>
    <li><p>Express the time it takes the first pilot to travel <m>500</m> miles as a function of the windspeed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Express the time it takes the second pilot to travel <m>400</m> miles as a function of the windspeed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Graph the two functions in the same window, and find the coordinates of the intersection point. Interpret those coordinates in the context of the problem.</p></li>
    <li><p>Both pilots check in with their instructors at the same time, and the first pilot has traveled <m>500</m> miles while the second pilot has gone <m>400</m> miles. Write an equation to describe this situation.</p></li>
    <li><p>Solve your equation to find the speed of the wind.</p></li>

<ol>
    <li><p>Write expressions for the time it takes for each leg of the trip if Andy drives a distance, <m>d</m>, at speed <m>r_1</m> and returns at speed <m>r_2</m>.</p></li>

<exercise number="60"><statement><p>The owner of a print shop volunteers to produce flyers for his candidate's campaign. His large printing press can complete the job in <m>4</m> hours, and the smaller model can finish the flyers in <m>6</m> hours. How long will it take to
print the flyers if he runs both presses simultaneously?
<ol>
    <li><p>Suppose that the large press can complete a job in <m>t_1</m> hours and the smaller press takes <m>t_2</m> hours. Write expressions for the fraction of a job that each press can complete in <m>1</m> hour.</p></li>
    <li><p>Write an expression for the fraction of a job that can be completed in <m>1</m> hour with both presses running simultaneously.</p></li>
    <li><p>Write an expression for the amount of time needed to complete the job with both presses running.</p></li>
    <li><p>Write your answer to part (c) as a simple fraction.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use your formula to answer the question stated in the problem.</p></li>
