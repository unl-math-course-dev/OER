    <p>An <term>equation</term> is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal, such as <m>3x-12=0</m>. A solution to an equation is any set of values that can replace the variables to produce a true statement. The variable in the equation <m>3x-12=0</m> is <m>x</m> and the solution is <m>x=4</m>. To verify this, substitute the value 4 in for <m>x</m> and check that you get a true statement:</p>
    
    <md>
        <mrow>3x-12 \amp =0</mrow>
        <mrow>3(\alert{4})-12 \amp=0</mrow>
        <mrow>12-12\amp =0</mrow>
        <mrow>0\amp =0</mrow>
        \end{aligned}</md>
    
    
    
    
    <p>Equations relating two variables are particularly useful. If we know the value of one of the variables, we can find the corresponding value of the other variable by solving the equation.</p>
    
    <example><statement>
        <p>
            The equation <m>w = 6h</m> gives Emily's wages, <m>w</m>, in terms of the number of hours she works, <m>h</m>. How many hours does Emily need to work next week if she wants to earn <m>\$225</m>?
        </p></statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            We know that <m>w = 225</m>, and we would like to know the value of <m>h</m>. We substitute the value for <m>w</m> into our equation and then solve for <m>h</m>.
            <md>
                <mrow>w \amp= 6h\amp\amp \text{Substitute 225 for }w.</mrow>
                <mrow>\alert{225} \amp= 6h\amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by } 6.</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{225}{\alert{6}}\amp = \frac{6h}{\alert{6}}\amp\amp \text{Simplify.}</mrow>
                <mrow>37.5\amp = h</mrow>
            </md>
            Emily must work <m>37.5</m> hours in order to earn <m>\$225</m>. In reality, Emily will probably have to work for <m>38</m> hours, because most employers do not pay for portions of an hour's work. Thus, Emily needs to work for <m>38</m> hours.

        To solve an equation we can generate simpler equations that have the same solutions. Equations that have identical solutions are called <term>equivalent equations</term><idx>equivalent equations</idx>. For example,
        <me>3x - 5 = x + 3</me>
        and
        <me>2x = 8</me>
        are equivalent equations because the solution of each equation is <m>4</m>. Often we can find simpler equivalent equations by undoing in reverse order the operations performed on the variable.
    </p></introduction>

<subsection><title>Solving Linear Equations</title>
    <p>
        <term>Linear</term>, or first-degree, equations can be written so that every term is either a constant or a constant times the variable. The equations above are examples of linear equations, as are the following:</p>
    
    <me>y=-5,\: \: \: y=4x,\: \: \: y=x+17,\: \: \: y=14-2x,\: \: \: y=13x+9-3x</me>
    
    <p>Notice that the last equation above is linear, even though it is not in its simplified form. All the terms <m>13x, 9, -3x</m> are either constants or constants times the variable <m>x</m>. If we simplify the equation, we have <m>y=13x-3x+9=10x+9</m>, and again, the terms <m>10x</m> and <m>9</m> are a constant times the variable and a constant, satisfying the conditions for a linear equation.</p>
    
    <p>Some examples of equations that are NOT linear are:</p>
    
    
    <me>y=x^3,\: \: \:  y=-4x^2+3,\: \: \:  y=3x-17+5x^3,\: \: \:  y=-2x+x^4,\: \: \:  y=x-9-2x^{15}</me>
    
    
        
        
        <p>Recall the following rules for solving linear equations.
    </p>
    
    <assemblage><title>To Generate Equivalent Equations</title>
        <p>
            <ol label="1">
                <li><p>
                    We can add or subtract the <em>same</em> number on <em>both</em> sides of an equation.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    We can multiply or divide <m>both</m> sides of an equation by the <m>same</m> number (except zero).

    <p>
        Applying either of these rules produces a new equation equivalent to the old one and thus preserves the solution. We use the rules to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
    </p>

        The following steps should enable you to solve any linear equation. Of course, you may not need all the steps for a particular equation.

            </md>
            Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable.

            The solution is <m>-3</m>.
        </p>
    </solution></example>
    
    
    <p>We will often come across the need to solve linear equations with fraction or decimal coefficients. In this case, we should "clear" the denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators, as shown in the following example.</p>
    
    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Solve <m>\frac{p-2}{3}+\frac{p}{4}=\frac{1}{2}</m>.
        </p></statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            We begin by finding the least common multiple of the three denominators: LCM<m>(3,4,2)=12</m>. Then we multiply both sides of the equation by <m>12</m>, and continue solving as normal.
            <me>\begin{aligned}
                \frac{p-2}{3}+\frac{p}{4}\amp =\frac{1}{2}\\
                (\alert{12})\left(\frac{p-2}{3}+\frac{p}{4}\right)\amp =(\alert{12})\frac{1}{2}\\
                4(p-2)+3p\amp =6\\
                4p-8+3p\amp =6\\
                7p-8\amp = 6\\
                7p\amp =14\\
                p\amp =2
                \end{aligned}</me>
            
         
            The solution is <m>p=2</m>.
        </p>
    </solution></example>
  
  <p>When we have decimal coefficients, it is sometimes easier to multiply through by <m>10,100</m>, etc. before solving the equation.</p>
  <example><statement>
      <p>
          Solve <m>0.04x+0.08x=-0.1+0.17x</m>.
      </p></statement>
  <solution>
      <p>
          Since the decimal coefficients have up to <m>2</m> decimal places, we will multiply each side of the equation by <m>100</m> before solving the equation.
          <me>\begin{aligned}
              0.04x+0.08x \amp =-0.1+0.17x\\
              (\alert{100})(0.04x+0.08x) \amp =(\alert{100})(-0.1+0.17x)\\
               4x+8x \amp =-10+17x\\
               12x\amp =-10+17x\\
               -5x\amp =-10\\
               x\amp =2
              \end{aligned}</me>
          
          
          The solution is <m>x=2</m>.

            The symbol <m>\gt</m> is called an <term>inequality symbol</term><idx>inequality symbol</idx>, and the statement <m>a\gt b</m> is called an <term>inequality</term><idx>inequality</idx>. There are four inequality symbols:
            <md>
                <mrow>\amp\gt \amp\amp\text{is greater than}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp\lt \amp\amp\text{is less than}</mrow>

                <mrow>\amp\le \amp\amp\text{is less than or equal to}</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
        <p>
            Inequalities that include the symbols <m>\gt</m> or <m>\lt</m> are called <term>strict inequalities</term><idx>strict inequalities</idx>; those that include <m>\ge</m> or <m>\le</m> are called <term>nonstrict</term><idx>nonstrict</idx>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must be reversed. For example, if we multiply both sides of the inequality
            <me>2\lt 5</me>
            by <m>-3</m>, we get
            <md>
                <mrow>\alert{-3}(2) \amp\gt \alert{-3}(5)\amp\amp \text{Change inequality symbol from }\lt \text{ to }\gt.</mrow>
                <mrow>-6 \amp\gt -15.</mrow>
            </md>
            Because of this property, the rules for solving linear equations must be revised slightly for solving linear inequalities.

        <p>
            The solutions of the inequality in <xref ref="example-compound-inequality" text="type-global"/> form an <term>interval</term><idx>interval</idx>. An interval is a set that consists of all the real numbers between two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The set <m>-2 \le x \le 2</m> includes its endpoints <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>, so we call it a <term>closed interval</term><idx>closed interval</idx>, and we denote it by <m>[-2, 2]</m> (see <xref ref="fig-numline-closed-vs-open" text="type-global"/>a). The square brackets tell us that the endpoints are included in the interval. An interval that does not include its endpoints, such as <m>-2 \lt x \lt 2</m>, is called an <term>open interval</term><idx>open interval</idx>, and we denote it with round brackets, <m>(-2, 2)</m> (see <xref ref="fig-numline-closed-vs-open" text="type-global"/>b).
        </p>
        
        <figure xml:id="fig-numline-closed-vs-open"><caption></caption><image source="../images/fig-numline-closed-vs-open.svg"><description>closed interval and open interval</description></image>
        </figure>
        
        <warning>
            <p>
                Do not confuse the open interval <m>(-2, 2)</m> with the point <m>(-2, 2)</m>! The notation is the same, so you must decide from the context whether an interval or a point is being discussed.
            </p>
        </warning>
        
        <p>
            We can also discuss <term>infinite intervals</term><idx>infinite intervals</idx>, such as <m>x\lt 3</m> and <m>x\ge -1</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-numline-infinite-intervals" text="type-global"/>. We denote the interval <m>x\lt 3</m> by <m>(-\infty, 3)</m>, and the interval <m>x\ge -1</m> by <m>[-1, \infty)</m>. The symbol <m>\infty</m>, for infinity, does not represent a specific real number but rather indicates that the interval continues forever along the real line.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig-numline-infinite-intervals"><caption></caption><image source="../images/fig-numline-infinite-intervals.svg"  width="70%"><description>infinite intervals</description></image> </figure>
        <p>
            Finally, we can combine two or more intervals into a larger set. For example, the set consisting of <m>x\lt -1</m> or <m>x\gt 2</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-numline-disjoint-infinite-intervals" text="type-global"/>, is the <term>union</term><idx>union</idx> of two intervals and is denoted by <m>(-\infty,-2) \cup (2,\infty)</m>.

        <p>
            Many solutions of inequalities are intervals or unions of intervals.

    <introduction>
    <p>Algebra simplifies the process of solving real-world problems. This is done by using letters to represent unknowns, restating problems in the form of equations, and by offering systematic techniques for solving those equations. To solve problems using algebra, first translate the wording of the problem into mathematical statements that describe the relationships between the given information and the unknowns. Usually, this translation to mathematical statements is the difficult step in the process. The key to the translation is to carefully read the problem and identify certain key words and phrases.</p>

        </row>
    </tabular></sidebyside>
    
    <p>When translating sentences into mathematical statements, be sure to read the sentence several times and parse out the key words and phrases. It is important to first identify the variable, let <m>x</m> represent it, and state in words what the unknown quantity is. This step not only makes our work more readable, but also forces us to think about what we are looking for.</p>
    
    
    <example><statement>
        <p>
            When 6 is subtracted from twice the sum of a number and 8, the result is 5. Find the number.
        </p></statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            Let <m>n</m> represent the unknown number.
            <me>
                2\cdot (n+8)-6=5
                </me>
            To understand why we included the parentheses in the set up, you must study the structure of the following two sentences and their translations:
            
            <sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
                <row bottom="minor">
            <cell>"twice the sum of a number and <m>8</m>"</cell>
            <cell><m>2(n+8)</m></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
            <cell>"the sum of <alert>twice a number </alert> and <m>8</m>"</cell>
            <cell><m>2n+8</m></cell>
        </row>
    </tabular></sidebyside>
        The key was to focus on the phrase “twice the sum,” this prompted us to group the sum within parentheses and then multiply by <m>2</m>. After translating the sentence into a mathematical statement we then solve.
        <me>\begin{aligned}
            2(n+8)-6 \amp = 5\\
            2n+16-6\amp = 5\\
            2n+10\amp =5\\
            2n\amp = -5\\
            n\amp = -\frac{5}{2}
            \end{aligned}
            </me>
        Check:
        <me>\begin{aligned}
            2(n+8)-6\amp = 2\left(\alert{-\frac{5}{2}}+8\right)-6\\
            \amp = 2\left(\frac{11}{2}\right)-6\\
            \amp = 11-6\\
            \amp =5
            \end{aligned}
            </me>
        Since our result is 5, we know we have the correct answer.

    <solution>
        <p>
            The sentence "The length is <m>2</m> meters less than <m>3</m> times the width" gives us the relationship between the two variables.</p>
            
        <p> Let <m>w</m> represent the width of the rectangle.</p>
            
        <p> Let <m>3w-2</m> represent the length.
        </p>
        
        <p>The sentence "A rectangle has a perimeter measuring <m>92</m> meters" suggests an algebraic set up. Substitute <m>92</m> for the perimeter and the expression <m>3w-2</m> for the length into the appropriate formula as follows:</p>

    <subsection><title>Currency Applications</title>
    <p> A new kind of problem we come across in applications is something we call currency problems. These problems involve finding the number of coins or bills given other information about value. It is important to be careful in defining our variables specifically - either for the number of currency or the value of the currency.</p>
    <example><statement>
        <p>
             Michael has <m>14</m> bills in his wallet altogether. If the wallet contains only $<m>5</m> and $<m>10</m> bills and Michael has 3 $<m>10</m> bills, how much money does Michael have in his wallet?
        </p></statement>
    <solution>
    <p>Let <m>f</m> be the number of five dollar bills. Because Michael has 14 bills in his wallet, and all are either fives or tens, he must have <m>14-3=11</m> fives in his wallet.</p>
    
            
        <p>
             Since a $<m>5</m> bill is worth <m>5</m> dollars, <m>5f</m> will give us the money amount of all the $<m>5</m> bills.
            The portion of the sentence which tells us that Michael has 3 $<m>10</m> bills tells us that the total amount of money in Michael's wallet is <m>5*f+3*10=5f+30</m> where <m>f</m> represents the number of $<m>5</m> in Michael's wallet.
            
           
           
                
                
                Since we have set up an linear equation, we can plug in the number of $<m>5</m> bills, 11:
                
                <me>5*11+30=85 </me>

                
                Michael has nine $<m>85</m> in his wallet.
                </p>
        </solution></example>
    
    <exercise><statement> Ashley has $17.25 in her piggy bank, which has only quarters and fifty-cent pieces in it.  Ashley has nine more fifty-cent pieces than she has quarters. How many coins of each denomination does she have?</statement>

    <subsection><title>Mixing Applications</title>
        <p>Mixture problems often include a percentage and some total amount. It is important to make a distinction between these two types of quantities. For example, if a problem states that a 10-ounce container is filled with a <m>3</m>% saline (salt) solution, then this means that the container is filled with a mixture of salt and water as follows:</p>
    
    <sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
            <row bottom="minor">
                    <cell><m></m></cell>
                    <cell><m>Percentage</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>Amount</m></cell>
                </row>
            <row>
                    <cell><m>Salt</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>3</m>%<m>=0.03</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>0.03</m> (<m>10</m> ounces)<m>=0.3</m> ounces</cell>
                </row>
            <row>
                     <cell><m>Water</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>97</m>%<m>=0.96</m></cell>
                    <cell><m>0.96</m> (<m>10</m> ounces)<m>=9.7</m> ounces</cell>
                </row>
    </tabular></sidebyside>
    
    
    <p>In other words, we multiply the percentage times the total to get the amount of each part of the mixture.</p>
    
    <example><statement>
        <p>How many milliliters of a <m>15</m>% alcohol solution must be mixed with <m>110</m> milliliters of a <m>35</m>% solution to obtain a <m>25</m>% solution?
            </p></statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
            Let <m>m</m> be the milliliters of the <m>15</m>% solution.</p>
            <p>To get the amount of the first part of the mixture, then, we multiply the percentage by the amount: <m>0.15m</m>.</p>
             <p>Likewise, to get the amount of the second part of the mixture, we multiply the percentage by the amount: <m>0.35\cdot 110=38.5</m>.</p>
             
             <p>Next we look at this problem from the overall viewpoint - we want a <m>25</m>% solution in the end. So again, to get the amount of the entire mixture, we multiply the percentage by the amount: <m>0.25(m+110)</m>.</p>
                 
                 <p>Now we have all the pieces of our equation, so we can set it up to solve:</p>
                 
                 <me>\begin{aligned}
                     0.15m+38.5\amp = 0.25(m+110)\\
                     0.15m +38.5 \amp =0.25m+27.5\\
                     38.5\amp = 0.10m+27.5\\
                     11\amp =0.10m\\
                     110\amp =m
                     \end{aligned}
                     </me>
                 
                 <p>We have found that we must mix <m>110</m> milliliters of a <m>15</m>% alcohol solution with <m>110</m> milliliters of a <m>35</m>% solution to obtain a <m>25</m>% solution.

<subsection><title>Distance Applications</title>
    
    <p>Recall that the distance traveled is equal to the average rate times the time traveled at that rate, <m>d=r\cdot t</m>. These problems usually have a lot of data, so it helps to carefully rewrite the pertinent information as you define variables.</p>
    
    
    <example><statement>
        <p>Two planes leave a city traveling in opposite directions. One travels at a rate of <m>530</m> mph and the other at a rate of <m>600</m> mph. How long will it take until they are <m>3672.5</m> miles apart?
        </p></statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            The first plane travels at a rate of <m>530</m> mph, meaning that its distance is modeled by the equation
            <me> d_1=r\cdot t= 530 t</me>
            The second plane travels at a rate of <m>600</m> mph, meaning that its distance is modeled by the equation
            <me> d_2=r\cdot t= 600 t</me>
            Now since the planes travel in <em>opposite</em> directions, the distance is getting bigger as time goes on, meaning that over time, we can measure the distance between the planes by adding the two distances:
            <me>d=d_1+d_2=530t+600t=1130t</me>
            Now, we want to know when the distance is <m>3672.5</m>. Thus we solve:
            <me>\begin{aligned}
                d\amp = 1130t\\
                3672.5\amp =1130t\\
                3.25\amp =t
                \end{aligned}
            </me>
            This tells us that it will take <m>3</m> hours and <m>15</m> minutes for the planes to be <m>3672.5</m> miles apart.
        </p>
    </solution>
    </example>
    
    <exercise><statement>
        <p>Dan and Ariel are <m>385.825</m> miles apart by sea. Dan sails north on his yacht towards Ariel, while Ariel sails south on her yacht towards Dan. Dan travels at <m>11</m> knots (<m>12.65</m> mph), while Ariel travels at <m>50</m> knots (<m>57.5</m> mph). How long will it take until they meet?
        </p></statement>
    <solution>
        It will take <m>5.5</m> hours until Dan and Ariel meet.

<section  xml:id="Relations-Graphs-Functions"><title>Relations, Graphs, and Functions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>The rectangular coordinate system consists of two real number lines that intersect at a right angle. The horizontal number line is called the <term><m>x</m>-axis</term>, and the vertical number line is called the <term><m>y</m>-axis</term>. These two number lines define a flat surface called a plane, and each point on this plane is associated with an <term>ordered pair</term> of real numbers <m>(x, y)</m>. The first number is called the <term><m>x</m>-coordinate</term>, and the second number is called the <term><m>y</m>-coordinate</term>. The intersection of the two axes is known as the <term>origin</term>, which corresponds to the point <m>(0, 0)</m>.</p>
    
    <p>The <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes break the plane into four regions called <term>quadrants</term>, named using Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV, as pictured. The ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m> represents the position of points relative to the origin. For example, the ordered pair <m>(−4, 3)</m> represents the position <m>4</m> units to the left of the origin, and <m>3</m> units above in the second quadrant.</p>

    <image source="../images/Quadrants.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image>
   
    
    <p>Next, we define a <term>relation</term> as any set of ordered pairs, graphs, correspondences, tables, or equations. In the context of algebra, the relations of interest are sets of ordered pairs <m>(x, y)</m> in the rectangular coordinate plane. Typically, the coordinates are related by a rule expressed using an algebraic equation (but can also be related via tables, graphs, or diagrams). </p>
        <p>For example, consider the absolute value function, denoted <m>|a|</m>. This function takes an input <m>a</m> and tells us its distance from zero. For instance, <m>|5|=5</m>, <m>|-7|=7</m>, and <m>|-112|=112</m>. Now let's consider the algebraic equations <m>y=|x|-2</m> and <m>x=|y|+1</m>. Both these equations define relationships between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> involving the absolute values. Following are some integers that satisfy both equations:</p>
    
    <image source="../images/SolutionsAbsValue.png"><description>Solutions to Absolute Value Equations</description></image>
    
    
    <p>Here two relations consisting of seven ordered pair solutions are obtained:</p>
    
    <small>
    <md>
        <mrow>y\amp=|x|-2\text{ has solutions }{(-3,1),(-2,0),(-1,-1),(0,-2),(1,-1),(2,0),(3,1)}</mrow>
        <mrow>x\amp =|y|+1\text{ has solutions }{(4,-3),(3,-2),(2,-1),(1,0),(2,1),(3,2),(4,3)}</mrow>
    </md>
    </small>
    
    <p>We can visually display any relation of this type on a coordinate plane by plotting the points, or ordered pairs.</p>
    
    <image source="../images/AbsValue1.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image>
    
    <p>The solution sets of each equation will form a relation consisting of infinitely many ordered pairs. We can use the given ordered pair solutions to estimate all of the other ordered pairs by drawing a line through the given points. Here we put an arrow on the ends of our lines to indicate that this set of ordered pairs continues without bounds.</p>
    
    <image source="../images/AbsValue2.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image>
    
    <p>The representation of a relation on a rectangular coordinate plane, as illustrated above, is called a <term>graph</term>. Any curve graphed on a rectangular coordinate plane represents a set of ordered pairs and thus defines a relation.</p>
    
    <p>The set consisting of all of the first components of a relation, in this case the <m>x</m>-values, is called the <term>domain</term>. And the set consisting of all second components of a relation, in this case the <m>y</m>-values, is called the <term>range</term> (or codomain). Often, we can determine the domain and range of a relation if we are given its graph.</p>
    
    <image source="../images/AbsValue3.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image>
    
    <p>Here we can see that the graph of <m>y=|x|-2</m> has a domain consisting of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}=(-\infty,\infty)</m>, and a range of all <m>y</m>-values greater than or equal to <m>−2</m>, <m>[-2,\infty)</m>. The domain of the graph of <m>x=|y|+1</m> consists of all <m>x</m>-values greater than or equal to <m>1</m>, <m>[1,\infty)</m>, and the range consists of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}=(-\infty,\infty)</m>.</p>

        <p>
            The minimum <m>x</m>-value represented on the graph is <m>-8</m> and all others are larger. Therefore the domain consists of all <m>x</m>-values in the interval <m>[-8,\infty)</m>. The minimum <m>y</m>-value represented on the graph is <m>0</m> so the range is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.

    <subsection xml:id="Functions"><title>Functions</title>
        
        <p>Of special interest are relations where every <m>x</m>-value corresponds to exactly one <m>y</m>-value. A relation with this property is called a <term>function</term>.</p>
        
        <example><statement>
            <p>
                Determine the domain and range of the following relation and state whether it is a function or not: <m>\lbrace (-1,4),(0,7),(2,3),(3,3),(4,-2)\rbrace</m>.
            </p></statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Here we separate the domain (<m>x</m>-values), and the range (<m>y</m>-values), and depict the correspondence between the values with arrows.</p>
            
             <image source="../images/FunctionCorrespondence.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image>
             
             <p>The relation is a function because each <m>x</m>-value corresponds to exactly one <m>y</m>-value. The domain is <m>\{−1, 0, 2, 3, 4\}</m> and the range is <m>\{−2, 3, 4, 7\}</m>.</p>
         
        </solution></example>
        
        <example><statement>
            <p>
                Determine the domain and range of the following relation and state whether it is a function or not: <m>\lbrace (-4,-3),(-2,6),(0,3),(3,5),(3,7)\rbrace</m>.

            <p>
                <image source="../images/FunctionCorrespondence2.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image></p>
            
            
            <p>The relation is not a function because the <m>x</m>-value <m>3</m> corresponds to two <m>y</m>-values. We can also recognize functions as relations where no <m>x</m>-values are repeated (ignoring redundancy). The domain is <m>\{−4, -2, 0, 3\}</m> and the range is <m>\{−3, 3, 5, 6, 7\}</m>.</p>
            
        </solution></example>
       
        
        <p>Consider the relations consisting of the seven ordered pair solutions to <m>y=|x|-2</m> and <m>x=|y|+1</m>. The correspondence between the domain and range of each can be pictured as follows:</p>
        
        <p> <image source="../images/FunctionCorrespondence3.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image></p>
        
        <p>Notice that every element in the domain of the solution set of <m>y=|x|-2</m> corresponds to only one element in the range; it is a function. The solutions to <m>x=|y|+1</m>, on the other hand, have values in the domain that correspond to two elements in the range. In particular, the <m>x</m>-value <m>4</m> corresponds to two <m>y</m>-values <m>−3</m> and <m>3</m>. Therefore, <m>x=|y|+1</m> does not define a function.</p>
        
        <p>We can visually identify functions by their graphs using the <term>vertical line test</term>. If any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a function.</p>
        
          <image source="../images/VertLineTestonAbsValue.png"><description>Vertical Line Test</description></image>
        
        <p>The vertical line represents a value in the domain, and the number of intersections with the graph represent the number of values to which it corresponds. As we can see, any vertical line will intersect the graph of <m>y=|x|-2</m> only once; therefore, it is a function. A vertical line can cross the graph of <m>x=|y|+1</m> more than once; therefore, it is not a function. As pictured, the <m>x</m>-value <m>3</m> corresponds to more than one <m>y</m>-value.</p>
        
        <example><statement>
            <p>
               Given the graph, state the domain and range and determine whether or not it represents a function:</p>
            
            <p> <image source="../images/Circle.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image></p>
            </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                From the graph we can see that the minimum <m>x</m>-value is <m>−1</m> and the maximum <m>x</m>-value is <m>5</m>. Hence, the domain consists of all the real numbers in the set from <m>[−1,5]</m>. The maximum <m>y</m>-value is <m>3</m> and the minimum is <m>−3</m>, so the range consists of <m>y</m>-values in the interval <m>[−3,3]</m>.</p>
            
            <p> <image source="../images/CircleVertLineTest.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image></p>
            
            <p>In addition, since we can find a vertical line that intersects the graph more than once, we conclude that the graph is not a function. There are many <m>x</m>-values in the domain that correspond to two <m>y</m>-values.</p>
            
            <p> The domain, in interval notation, is <m>[-1,5]</m> and the range is <m>[-3,3]</m>. The relation is not a function.</p>

    <subsection><title>Function Notation</title>
        <p> With the definition of a function comes special notation. If we consider each x-value to be the input that produces exactly one output, then we can use <term>function notation</term>:</p>
        
        <md>
            <mrow> f(x)=y</mrow>
        </md>
        
        <p>The notation <m>f(x)</m> is read as, “<m>f</m> of <m>x</m>” and should not be confused with multiplication. Algebra frequently involves functions, and so the notation becomes useful when performing common tasks. Here <m>f</m> is the function name, and <m>f(x)</m> denotes the value in the range associated with the value <m>x</m> in the domain. Functions are often named with different letters; some common names for functions are <m>f, g, h, C</m>, and <m>R</m>. We have determined that the set of solutions to <m>y=|x|-2</m> is a function; therefore, using function notation we can write <m>\alert{f(x)}=|x|-2</m> instead of <m>y=|x|-2</m>.</p>
        
        <p>It is important to note that <m>y</m> and <m>f(x)</m> are used interchangeably. This notation is used as follows:</p>
        
        <md>
            <mrow> f(x)\amp = |x|-2</mrow>
            <mrow> f(-5)\amp=|-5|-2=5-2=3</mrow>
        </md>
        
        <p>Here the compact notation <m>f(-5)=3</m> indicates that where <m>x=-5</m> (the input), the function results in <m>y=3</m> (the output). In other words, replace the variable with the value given inside the parentheses.</p>
        
         <image source="../images/InputOutput.png"><description>Input and Output</description></image>
         
               <p>From above, we can see that our output depends on our input. Another way we define this is to call our input <m>x</m> the <term>independent variable</term> and our output <m>y</m> the <term>dependent variable</term>. Indeed, above, our function's output was <em>dependent</em> upon what the input was - when we put in <m>-5</m>, we got out the answer <m>3</m>.</p>
         
         <example><statement>
             <p>
                Consider the function <m>M=53+14t</m> where <m>M</m> represents miles from home on Gabby's bike trip as a function of <m>t</m>, the number of hours since Gabby left her office. Which is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?</p>
         </statement>
         <solution>
             <p>Recall our study of translating word problems to equations. The phrase "a function of", tells us our input, or independent variable is time <m>t</m>. </p>
             
             <p>The independent variable is <m>t</m>, and the dependent variable is <m>M</m>.</p>
               </solution>
         </example>
        
        <p>Function notation streamlines the task of evaluating. For example, use the function <m>h</m> defined by <m>h(x)=\frac{1}{2}x-3</m> to evaluate for <m>x</m>-values in the set <m>{-2,0,7}</m>.</p>
        
        <md>
            <mrow>h(-2)=\frac{1}{2}(-2)-3=-1-3=-4</mrow>
            <mrow>h(0)=\frac{1}{2}(0)-3=0-3=-3</mrow>
            <mrow>h(7)=\frac{1}{2}(7)-3=\frac{7}{2}-3=\frac{1}{2}</mrow>
        </md>
        
        
        <p>Given any function defined by <m>h(x)=y</m> the input <m>x</m> can be any algebraic expression. For example:</p>
        
        <md>
            <mrow>h(4a^3)=\frac{1}{2}(4a^3)-3=2a^3-3</mrow>
            <mrow>h(2x-1)=\frac{1}{2}(2x-1)-3=x-\frac{1}{2}-3=x-\frac{7}{2}</mrow>

        </statement>
        <solution>
            
            <p> Recall that when evaluating, it is a best practice to begin by replacing the variables with parentheses and then substitute the appropriate values. This helps with the order of operations when simplifying expressions.</p>

<section  xml:id="Slope"><title>The Slope of a Line</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>Recall that the set of all solutions to a linear equation can be represented on a rectangular coordinate plane using a straight line through at least two points; this line is called its graph. For example, to graph the linear equation <m>8x+4y=12</m> we would first solve for <m>y</m>.</p>
    
    <md>
        <mrow>8x+4y\amp = 12</mrow>
        <mrow> 4y \amp = -8x+12</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =\frac{-8x+12}{4}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp = \frac{-8x}{4}+\frac{12}{4}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp = -2x+3</mrow>
    </md>
    
    <p>Written in this form, we can see that <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>; in other words, <m>x</m> is the independent variable and <m>y</m> is the dependent variable. Choose at least two <m>x</m>-values and find the corresponding <m>y</m>-values. It is a good practice to choose zero, some negative numbers, as well as some positive numbers. Here we will choose five <m>x</m> values, determine the corresponding <m>y</m>-values, and then form a representative set of ordered pair solutions.</p>

    <p>Plot the points and draw a line through the points. We add arrows on either end to indicate that the graph extends indefinitely.</p>
    
    
    <p> <image source="../images/Slope1.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
    
    <p>The resulting line represents all solutions to <m>8x+4y=12</m>, of which there are infinitely many. The above process describes the technique for graphing known as plotting points. This technique will be used to graph more complicated functions as we progress in this course.</p>
    
    <p>The steepness of any incline can be measured as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. For example, a <m>5</m>% incline can be written as <m>\frac{5}{100}</m>, which means that for every 100 feet forward, the height increases 5 feet.</p>
    
    
    <p> <image source="../images/SlopePercentIncline.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
    
    <p>In mathematics, we call the incline of a line the slope, denoted by the letter <m>m</m>. The vertical change is called the rise and the horizontal change is called the run. Given any two points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, we can obtain the rise and run by subtracting the corresponding coordinates.</p>
    
    
    <p> <image source="../images/SlopeIncline.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
    
    <p>This leads us to the slope formula. Given any two points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, the slope is given by:</p>
    
    <md>
        <mrow>\alert{\text{Slope }}= m=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \alert{\frac{\text{Change in }y}{\text{Change in }x}}</mrow></md>
    
    <p>The Greek letter delta <m>(\Delta)</m> is often used to describe the change in a quantity. Therefore, the slope is sometimes described using the notation <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>, which represents the change in <m>y</m> divided by the change in <m>x</m>.</p>
    
    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Find the slope of the line passing through <m>(−3, −5)</m> and <m>(2, 1)</m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        
        <p>Given <m>(−3, −5)</m> and <m>(2, 1)</m>, calculate the difference of the <m>y</m>-values divided by the difference of the <m>x</m>-values. Take care to be consistent when subtracting the coordinates:</p>
        
        <p>Let <m>(x_1,y_1)=(-3,-5)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)=(2,1)</m>.</p>

            \begin{aligned}
            m\amp = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
            \amp =\frac{1-(-5)}{2-(-3)}\\
            \amp =\frac{1+5}{2+3}\\
            \amp =\frac{6}{5}
            \end{aligned}
            </me>
        
        <p>The slope is given by <m>m=\frac{6}{5}</m>.</p>
    </solution></example>
    
    <p>It does not matter which point you consider to be the first and second when calculating slope. However, because subtraction is not commutative, you must take care to subtract the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point in the same order. For example, we obtain the same result in the example above if we apply the slope formula with the points switched:</p>
    
    <p>Let <m>(x_1,y_1)=(2,1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)=(-3,-5)</m>.</p>
    
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        m\amp = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
        \amp =\frac{-5-1}{-3-2}\\
        \amp =\frac{-6}{-5}\\
        \amp =\frac{6}{5}
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    
    <p>We can verify that the slope is <m>\frac{6}{5}</m> by graphing the line described in the previous example.</p>
    
      <p> <image source="../images/Slope2.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
    
    <p>Certainly the graph is optional - the beauty of the slope formula is that, given any two points, we can obtain the slope using only algebra.</p>

    <p>Reading the graph from left to right, lines with an upward incline have positive slopes and lines with a downward incline have negative slopes. The other two cases involve horizontal and vertical lines. Recall that if k is a real number we have</p>

    <p>Notice that the points on the horizontal line share the same <m>y</m>-values. Therefore, the rise is zero and hence the slope is zero. The points on the vertical line share the same <m>x</m>-values. Consequently, the run is zero, leading to an undefined slope. In general,</p>

    <subsection><title>Meaning of Slope</title>
        
        <p>Consider the equation <m>C=4+2t</m> representing the cost of a movie rental in terms of the number of days of the rental. If we graph this equation, we can choose any two points on the line to compute its slope. For example, if we choose the points <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(4,12)</m> then we have the following slope.</p>
        
        <me>m=\frac{12-4}{4-0}=\frac{8}{4}=2.</me>
        
        <p>The slope of the line is <m>2</m>. In terms of renting a movie, our slope expression is telling us</p>
        
        <me>
            \frac{\text{Change in Cost}}{\text{Change in Time}}=\frac{8 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ days}}</me>
    
    <p>In other words, if we were to increase the length of the rental by <m>4</m> days, the cost of the rental increases by <m>8</m> dollars. The slope gives the rate of increase in the rental fee, <m>$2</m> per day. </p>
    
    <p>In general, we say the slope of a line or equation measures the <term>rate of change</term> of the output variable with respect to the input variable. Depending on the units involved, this rate might be interpreted as a rate of growth or a rate of speed. A negative slope may represent a rate of decrease or a rate of consumption. The slope, or rate of change, of a graph can give us valuable information about the variables.</p>
    
    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Nathan went hiking and took some trail mix. After hiking <m>2.5</m> miles he had eaten <m>3</m> ounces of trail mix. On average, how many ounces of trail mix did Nathan eat per mile?
            </p></statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The amount of trail mix that Nathan has eaten depends on how far he has hiked. This tells us that the independent variable is the distance he has hiked, in miles, and the dependent variable is the ounces of trail mix. We are looking for the average rate of change of ounces of trail mix per mile.
                </p>
                
                <me>\frac{\text{change in ounces of trail mix}}{\text{change in miles climbed}}=\frac{3\text{ ounces}}{2.5\text{ miles}}=1.2 \text{ ounces per mile}</me>
                
                
                <p> This tells us that Nathan ate <m>3</m> ounces of trail mix per mile on his hike.</p>

    <subsection><title>Linear Functions</title>
        
        <p>Given any linear equation in standard form, <m>ax+by=c,</m> we can solve for <m>y</m> to obtain <term>slope-intercept form</term>, <m>y=mx+b</m>. For example,</p>
        
        <md>
            <mrow>3x-4y\amp =8</mrow>
            <mrow>-4y\amp = -3x+8</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =\frac{-3x+8}{-4}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp = \frac{-3x}{-4}+\frac{8}{-4}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp = \frac{3}{4}x-2</mrow>
        </md>
        
        <p>Where <m>x=0</m>, we can see that <m>y=-2</m> and thus <m>(0,-2)</m> is an ordered pair solution. This is the point where the graph intersects the <m>y</m>-axis and is called the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>. We can use this point and the slope as a means to quickly graph a line. For example, to graph <m>y=\frac{3}{4}x-2</m>, start at the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,-2)</m> and mark off the slope to find a second point. Then use these points to graph the line as follows:</p>
        
          <p> <image source="../images/Slope4.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
        
        <p>Since this graph passes the vertical line test, this graph represents a function. Furthermore, the domain and range consists of all real numbers.</p>
        
          <p> <image source="../images/Slope5.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
        
        <p>In general, a <term>linear function</term> is a function that can be written in the form</p>
        
        <md>
            <mrow> f(x)=mx+b </mrow>
        </md>
        
        <p>where the slope <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> represent any real numbers. Since <m>y=f(x)</m>, we can use <m>y</m> and <m>f(x)</m> interchangeably, and ordered pair solutions on the graph <m>(x,y)</m> can be written in the form <m>(x,f(x))</m>.</p>
        
        <p>We know that any <m>y</m>-intercept will have an <m>x</m>-value equal to zero. Therefore, the <m>y</m>-intercept can be expressed as the ordered pair <m>(0,f(0))</m>. For linear functions,</p>
        
        <md>
            <mrow>f(\alert{0})=m(\alert{0})+b=b.</mrow>
        </md>
        
        <p>Hence the <m>y</m>-intercept of any linear function is <m>(0,b)</m>. To find the <term><m>x</m>-intercept</term>, the point where the function intersects the <m>x</m>-axis, we find <m>x</m> where <m>y=0</m> or <m>f(x)=0</m>.</p>
        
        <example><statement>
            <p>
                Graph the linear function <m>f(x)=−\frac{5}{3}x+6</m> and label the <m>x</m>-intercept.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            
            <p>From the function, we see that <m>f(0)=6</m> (or <m>b=6</m>) and thus the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0, 6)</m>. Also, we can see that the slope is <m>m=−\frac{5}{3}=\frac{-5}{3}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}</m>. Starting from the <m>y</m>-intercept, mark a second point down <m>5</m> units and right <m>3</m> units. Draw the line passing through these two points.</p>
            
              <p> <image source="../images/Slope6.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
            
            <p>To determine the <m>x</m>-intercept, find the <m>x</m>-value where the function is equal to zero. In other words, determine <m>x</m> where <m>f(x)=0</m>.</p>
            
            <me>
                \begin{aligned}
                f(x)\amp =-\frac{5}{3}x+6\\
                0\amp =-\frac{5}{3}x+6\\
                \frac{5}{3}x\amp =6\\
                \left(\alert{\frac{3}{5}}\right)\frac{5}{3}x\amp =\left(\alert{\frac{3}{5}}\right)6\\

                </me>
            
            <p>Therefore, the <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>\left(\frac{18}{5},0\right)</m>. The general rule is to label all important points that cannot be clearly read from the graph.</p>

    <subsection><title>Graphical Interpretation of Linear Equations and Inequalities</title>
        
        <p>We can use the ideas in this section to develop a geometric understanding of what it means to solve equations of the form <m>f(x)=g(x)</m>, where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are inear functions. Using algebra, we can solve the linear equation <m>\frac{1}{2}x+1=3</m> as follows:</p>
        
        <md>

        <p>The solution to this equation is <m>x=4</m>. Geometrically, this is the x-value of the intersection of the two graphs <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x+1</m> and <m>g(x)=3</m>. The idea is to graph the two linear functions and determine where the graphs coincide.</p>

        <p>We can extend the geometric interpretation a bit further to solve inequalities. For example, we can solve the linear inequality <m>\frac{1}{2}x+1\geq 3</m>, as follows:</p>

        <p>The solution set consists of all real numbers greater than or equal to 4. Geometrically, these are the <m>x</m>-values for which the graph <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x+1</m> lies above the graph of <m>g(x)=3</m>.</p>

        <p>Given the algebraic equation of a line, we can graph it in a number of ways. In this section, we will be given a geometric description of a line and find the algebraic equation. Finding the equation of a line can be accomplished in a number of ways. The following example makes use of slope-intercept form, <m>y=mx+b</m>, or using function notation, <m>f(x)=mx+b</m>. If we can determine the slope, <m>m</m>, and the <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>(0,b)</m>, we can then construct the equation.</p>

        <p>Point-slope form is particularly useful for finding the equation of a line given the slope and any ordered pair solution. After finding the slope, <m>-\frac{5}{4}</m> in the previous example, we could use this form to find the equation. Using the point <m>(-3,6)</m>, we substitute as follows:</p>

        <p>Notice that we obtain the same linear function <m>f(x)=-\frac{5}{4}x+\frac{9}{4}</m>.</p>
        
        <p>Note: Sometimes a variable is not expressed explicitly in terms of another; however, it is still assumed that one variable is dependent on the other. For example, the equation <m>2x+3y=6</m> implicitly represents the function <m>f(x)=-\frac{2}{3}x+2</m>. You should become comfortable with working with functions in either form.</p>

    <subsection><title>Elementary Functions</title>
        <p>In this section we graph two elementary functions that will be used throughout this course. Each function is graphed by plotting points. Remember that <m>f(x)=y</m> and thus <m>f(x)</m> and <m>y</m> can be used interchangeably.</p>
        
        <p>Any function of the form <m>f(x)=c</m>, where <m>c</m> is any real number, is called a <term>constant function</term>. Constant functions are linear and can be written in the form <m>f(x)=0x+c</m>. In this form, it is clear that the slope is 0 and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,c)</m>. Evaluating any value for <m>x</m>, such as <m>x=2</m>, will result in <m>c</m>.</p>
        
       <p> <image source="../images/ElementaryFunction.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
        
        <p>The graph of a constant function is a horizontal line. The domain consists of all real numbers <m>\mathbb{R}=(-\infty,\infty)</m> and the range consists of the single value <m>{c}</m>.</p>
        
        <p>We next define the <term>identity function</term> <m>f(x)=x</m>. Evaluating any value for <m>x</m> will result in the same value. For example, <m>f(0)=0</m> and <m>f(2)=2</m>. The identity function is linear, <m>f(x)=1x+0</m>, with slope <m>m=1</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,0)</m>.</p>
        
        <p> <image source="../images/IdentityFunction.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>
        
        <p>The domain and range both consist of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}=(-\infty,\infty)</m>.</p>
