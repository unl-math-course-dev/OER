<title>Inverse Functions</title>
<introduction>
    <p> Recall that in section 6.2 we gave the following definition of an inverse function:
        </p>
    
        <assemblage><title>Inverse Functions</title><idx>inverse functions</idx>
         <p>       Suppose the inverse of <m>f</m> is a function, denoted by <m>f^{-1}</m>. Then
                <me>f^{-1}(y) = x \text{ if and only if }f(x) = y.</me>
         </p>
        </assemblage>
        
        <p>
            Also in section 6.2, we stated the following property about inverse functions:
        </p>
        <xi:include href="./assemblage-functions-and-inverse-functions.xml" />
    <p>
        In this section we will explore the invertability of a function. In other words, by the end of this section we will be able to test if a function is invertable.

<subsection><title>Graph of the Inverse Function</title>

<sidebyside widths="50% 35%">
	<p>
	In <xref ref="example-Celsius-and-Fahrenheit" text="type-global"/>, we used a graph of <m>h</m> to read values of <m>h^{-1}</m>. But we can also plot the graph of <m>h^{-1}</m> itself. Because <m>C</m> is the input variable for <m>h^{-1}</m>, we plot <m>C</m> on the horizontal axis and <m>F</m> on the vertical axis. To find some points on the graph of <m>h^{-1}</m>, we interchange the coordinates of points on the graph of <m>h</m>. The graph of <m>h^{-1}</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig-Fahrenheit-vs-Celsius" text="type-global"/>.

<subsection><title>When Is the Inverse a Function?</title>
<p>
	We can always find the inverse of a function <m> y=f(x) </m> simply by solving for <m> x </m> thus interchanging the role of the input and output variables. In the preceding examples, this process created a new function. However, this process does not always lead to be a function.</p>

	<p> For example, to find the inverse of <m>y = f (x) = x^2</m>, we solve for <m>x</m> to get <m>x = \pm\sqrt{y}</m>. When we regard <m>y</m> as the input and <m>x</m> as the output, the relationship does not describe a function. This can be seen as plugging in <m> y=4 </m>, for example, gives two outputs <m> x=2 </m> and <m> x=-2</m>. The graphs of <m>f</m> and its inverse are shown in <xref ref="fig-graphs-of-f-and-inverse" text="type-global"/>. (Note that for the graph of the inverse, we plot <m>y</m> on the horizontal axis and <m>x</m> on the vertical axis.) Because the graph of the inverse does not pass the vertical line test, it is not a function.</p>
	<figure xml:id="fig-graphs-of-f-and-inverse"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-graphs-of-f-and-inverse"  width="70%"><description>graphs of x-squared and its inverse</description></image></figure>

<p>
    Notice that the graph of the inverse, shown on the right, does not describe a function as the graph does not pass the vertical line test.
    </p>
<p>
	For many applications, it is important to know whether or not the inverse of <m>f</m> is a function. This can be determined from the graph of <m>f</m>. When we interchange the roles of the input and output variables, horizontal lines of the form <m>y = k</m> become vertical lines.</p>

	<p> Thus, if the graph of the <em>inverse</em> is going to pass the vertical line test, the graph of the <em>original function</em> must pass the <term>horizontal line test</term><idx>horizontal line test</idx>, namely, that no horizontal line should intersect the graph in more than one point. Notice that the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2</m> does not pass the horizontal line test, so we would not expect its inverse to be a function.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Horizontal Line Test</title><idx>horizontal line test</idx>
	<p>
		If no horizontal line intersects the graph of a function more than once, then its inverse is also a function.
	</p>
</assemblage>

    <figure xml:id="fig-horizontal-line-test-animation"><caption>Notice that as the line moves up the <m>y-</m> axis, it only ever intersects the graph in a single place.  This means this function is invertible. </caption><image source="images/HorizontalLineTest.gif"   width="70%"><description>Horizontal line test</description></image></figure>
    <figure xml:id="fig-horizontal-line-test-fail-animation"><caption>Notice that as the line moves up the <m>y-</m> axis, it sometimes intersects the graph in more than one place.  This means this function is not invertible. </caption><image source="images/HorizontalLineTestFail.gif"   width="70%"><description>Horizontal line test</description></image></figure>





<p>
    We have been talking about how to tell if the inverse of a function is also a function, but in practice this is not the language typicaly used. Usually we ask this same question in the form "Is the function invertible?" The following definition explains this relationship:
    
    <assemblage><title>Invertible Function</title><idx>Invertible Function</idx>
        <p>
            If <m> y=f(x) </m> is a function such that its inverse, <m> x=f^{-1}(y)</m>, is also a function then we say that <m> f(x) </m> is an <term> invertible function </term>.
        </p>
    </assemblage>
    
    </p>


<example xml:id="example-invertible-or-not"><statement>

</statement><solution>
<p>
	In each case, apply the horizontal line test to determine whether the function is invertible. Because no horizontal line intersects their graphs more than once, the functions pictured in <xref ref="fig-invertible-or-not">Figures</xref>(a) and (c) are invertible. The functions in <xref ref="fig-invertible-or-not">Figures</xref>(b) and (d) are not invertibe.

<subsection><title>Mathematical Properties of the Inverse Function</title>
<p>
	The inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m> undoes the effect of the function <m>f</m>. In <xref ref="example-inverse-formula" text="type-global"/>, the function <m>f(t) = 6 + 2t</m> multiplies the input by <m>2</m> and then adds <m>6</m> to the result. The inverse function <m>f^{-1}(H) = \dfrac{H -6}{2}</m> undoes those operations in reverse order: It subtracts <m>6</m> from the input and then divides the result by <m>2</m>.</p>

	<p> If we apply the function <m>f</m> to a given input value and then apply the function <m>f^{-1}</m> to the output from <m>f</m>, the end result will be the original input value. For example, if we choose <m>t = 5</m> as an input value, we find that
	\begin{align*}
	f(\alert{5})\amp= 6 + 2(\alert{5}) 
	= \blert{16}\amp\amp\text{ Multiply by 2, then add 6.}\\
	\text{and } f^{-1}(\blert{16}) \amp = \frac{\blert{16} - 6}{2}
	= \alert{5}.\amp\amp\text{Subtract 6, then divide by 2.}
	\end{align*}</p>

<p>
	<xref ref="example-inverse-of-inverse" text="type-global"/> illustrates the fact that if <m>f^{-1}</m> is the inverse function for <m>f</m>, then <m>f</m> is also the inverse function for <m>f^{-1}</m>.

<subsection><title>Symmetry</title>
<p>
	So far we have been careful to keep track of the input and output variables when we work with inverse functions. This is important when we are dealing with applications; the names of the variables are usually chosen because they have a meaning in the context of the application, and it would be confusing to change them.
</p>
<p>
	However, we can also study inverse functions purely as mathematical objects. There is a relationship between the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse that is easier to see if we plot them both on the same set of axes.</p>
	<p> A graph does not change if we change the names of the variables, so we can let <m>x</m> represent the input for both functions, and let <m>y</m> represent the output. Consider the function <m>C = h(F)</m> from <xref ref="example-Celsius-and-Fahrenheit" text="type-global"/>, and its inverse function, <m>F = h^{-1}(C)</m>. The formulas for these functions are
	\begin{align*}
	C \amp = h(F) = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)\\
	F \amp = h^{-1}(C) = 32 + \frac{9}{5}C.
	\end{align*}
	But their graphs are the same if we write them as
	\begin{align*}
	y \amp = h(x) =\frac{5}{9}(x - 32)\\
	y \amp= h^{-1}(x) = 32 + \frac{9}{5}x.
	\end{align*}
	The graphs are shown in <xref ref="fig-temperature-inverses" text="type-global"/>.</p>
	<figure xml:id="fig-temperature-inverses"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-temperature-inverses"  width="45%"><description>graphs of both function and inverse</description></image></figure>

<p>
	Now, for every point <m>(a, b)</m> on the graph of <m>f</m>, the point <m>(b, a)</m> is on the graph of the inverse function. Observe in <xref ref="fig-temperature-inverses" text="type-global"/> that the points <m>(a, b)</m> and <m>(b, a)</m> are always located symmetrically across the line <m>y=x</m>. The graphs are <term>symmetric about the line <m>y=x</m></term>, which means that if  we were to place a mirror along the line <m>y=x</m>, each graph would be the reflection of the other.
</p>
<example xml:id="example-graph-inverse"><statement>
<p>
	Graph the function <m>f (x) = 2\sqrt{x + 4}</m> on the domain <m>[-4, 12]</m>. Graph its inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m> on the same grid.
</p>
</statement><solution>
<p>
	The graph of <m>f</m> has the same shape as the graph of <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m>, shifted <m>4</m> units to the left and stretched vertically by a factor of <m>2</m>. <xref ref="fig-graphs-and-tables-of-inverses" text="type-global"/>a shows the graph of <m>f</m>, along with a table of values. By interchanging the rows of the table, we obtain points on the graph of the inverse function, shown in <xref ref="fig-graphs-and-tables-of-inverses" text="type-global"/>b.</p>
