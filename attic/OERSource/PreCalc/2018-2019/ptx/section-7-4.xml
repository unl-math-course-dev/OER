<title>Graphing Rational Functions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	A rational function is the quotient of two polynomials. (As with rational numbers, the word <em>rational</em> refers to a ratio.)
</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-rational-function.xml" />

<p>
	The graphs of rational functions can be quite different from the graphs of polynomials.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-pedal-aircraft"><statement>
	<p>
		Francine is planning a 60-mile training flight through the desert on her cycle-plane, a pedal-driven aircraft. If there is no wind, she can pedal at an average speed of 15 miles per hour, so she can complete the flight in 4 hours. 
		<ol label="a">
			<li>
				<p>If there is a headwind of <m>x</m> miles per hour, it will take Francine longer to fly 60 miles. Express the time it will take to complete the training flight as a function of <m>x</m>.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>
				Make a table of values for the function.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Graph the function and explain what it tells you about the time Francine should allot for the flight.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		<ol label="a">
			<li><p>
				If there is a headwind of <m>x</m> miles per hour, Francine's ground speed will be <m>15 - x</m> miles per hour. Using the fact that time <m>\text{time} = \dfrac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}}</m>, we find that the time needed for the flight will be
				<me>
					t = f (x) = \frac{60}{15 - x}
				</me>
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				We evaluate the function for several values of <m>x</m>, as shown in the table below.</p>
				<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
			        <row bottom="minor">
			            <cell><m>x</m></cell>
			            <cell><m>0</m></cell>
			            <cell><m>3</m></cell>
			            <cell><m>5</m></cell>
			            <cell><m>7</m></cell>

			        </row>
			        <row>
			            <cell><m>t</m></cell>
			            <cell><m>4</m></cell>
			            <cell><m>5</m></cell>
			            <cell><m>6</m></cell>

			            <cell><m>12</m></cell>
			        </row>
			    </tabular></sidebyside>
			    <p>For example, if the headwind is <m>\alert{5}</m> miles per hour, then
			    <me>
			    	t=\frac{60}{15-\alert{5}}=\frac{60}{10}=6
			    </me>
			    Francine's effective speed is only <m>10</m> miles per hour, and it will take her <m>6</m> hours to fly the <m>60</m> miles. The table shows that as the speed of the headwind increases, the time required for the flight increases also.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				The graph of the function is shown in <xref ref="fig-graph-time-against-headwind" text="type-global"/>. You can use your calculator with the window
				<md>
					<mrow>
						\text{Xmin} \amp = -8.5 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 15
					</mrow>
					<mrow>
						\text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 30
					</mrow>
				</md>
				to verify the graph. In particular, the point <m>(0, 4)</m> lies on the graph. This point tells us that if there is no wind, Francine can fly <m>60</m> miles in <m>4</m> hours, as we calculated earlier.</p>
				
				<figure xml:id="fig-graph-time-against-headwind"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-graph-time-against-headwind"  width="50%"><description>graph showing time to complete trip vs speed of headwind</description></image></figure>
			
			<p>
				The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to <m>15</m> miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly <m>15</m> miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at <m>x = 15</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				What about negative values for <m>x</m>? If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine's flying time should decrease for negative <m>x</m>-values. For example, if <m>x = -5</m>, there is a tailwind of <m>5</m> miles per hour, so Francine's effective speed is <m>20</m>  miles per hour, and she can complete the flight in <m>3</m> hours. As the tailwind gets stronger (that is, as we move farther to the left in the <m>x</m>-direction), Francine's flying time continues to decrease, and the graph approaches the <m>x</m>-axis.

	The vertical dashed line at <m>x=15</m> on the graph of <m>t=\dfrac{60}{15-x}</m> is a <term>vertical asymptote</term><idx>vertical asymptote</idx> for the graph. We first encountered asymptotes in <xref ref="basic-functions" text="type-global"/> when we studied the graph of <m>y=\dfrac{1}{x}</m>. Locating the vertical asymptotes of a rational function is an important part of determining the shape of the graph.

		Queueing theory is used to predict your waiting time in a line, or queue. For example, suppose the attendant at a toll booth can process <m>6</m> vehicles per minute. The average total time spent by a motorist negotiating the toll booth depends on the rate, <m>r</m>, at which vehicles arrive, according to the formula

				<p>If EarthCare makes only one T-shirt, its cost is $105. But if more than one T-shirt is made, the cost of the original $100 investment is distributed among them. For example, the average cost per T-shirt for <m>\alert{2}</m> T-shirts is

				to verify the graph. Use the <em>Trace</em> to locate on the graph several points from the table of values. For example, the point <m>(5, 25)</m> indicates that if EarthCare makes <m>5</m> T-shirts, the cost per shirt is <m>\$25</m>.

			<p>
				The graph shows that as the number of T-shirts increases, the average cost per shirt continues to decrease, but not as rapidly as at first. Eventually the average cost levels off and approaches $5 per T-shirt. For example, if EarthCare produces <m>\alert{400}</m> T-shirts, the average cost per shirt is

Horizontal asymptotes are also important in sketching the graphs of rational functions.

<subsection><title>Domain of a Rational Function</title>
<p>
	Most applications of rational functions have restricted domains, that is, they make sense for only a subset of the real numbers on the <m>x</m>-axis. Consequently, only a portion of the graph is useful for analyzing the application. However, a knowledge of the general shape and properties of the whole graph can be very helpful in understanding a rational function.
</p>
<p>
	As we stated earlier, a rational function is a quotient of two polynomials. Some examples of rational functions are shown below.
	<md>
		<mrow>
			f(x)\amp=\frac{2}{(x-3)^2}\amp\amp\amp g(x)\amp=\frac{x}{x+1}
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			h(x)\amp=\frac{2x^2}{x^2+4}\amp\amp\amp k(x)\amp=\frac{x^2-1}{x^2-9}
		</mrow>
	</md>
	Because we cannot divide by zero, a rational function <m>f(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}}</m> is undefined for any value <m>x = a</m> where <m>Q(a) = 0</m>. These <m>x</m>-values are not in the domain of the function.
</p>

<example><statement>
	<p>
		Find the domains of the rational functions <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m> defined above.
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		The domain of <m>f</m> is the set of all real numbers except <m>3</m>, because the denominator, <m>(x - 3)^2</m>, equals <m>0</m> when <m>x = 3</m>.</p>
		<p> The domain of <m>g</m> is the set of all real numbers except <m>-1</m>, because <m>x + 1</m> equals zero when <m>x=-1</m>.</p>
		<p> The denominator of the function <m>h</m>, <m>x^2 + 4</m>, is never equal to zero, so the domain of <m>h</m> is all the real numbers.</p>
		<p> The domain of <m>k</m> is the set of all real numbers except <m>3</m> and <m>-3</m>, because <m>x^2 - 9</m> equals <m>0</m> when <m>x = 3</m> or <m>x = -3</m>.
	</p>
</solution></example>

<note><p>
	We only need to exclude the zeros of the <em>denominator</em> from the domain of a rational function. We do not exclude the zeros of the numerator. In fact, the zeros of the numerator include the zeros of the rational function itself, because a fraction is equal to <m>0</m> when its numerator is <m>0</m> but its denominator is not <m>0</m>.

<subsection><title>Vertical Asymptotes</title>
<p>
	As we saw in <xref ref="Graphing-Polynomial-Functions" text="type-global"/>, a polynomial function is defined for all values of <m>x</m>, and its graph is a smooth curve without any breaks or holes. The graph of a rational function, on the other hand, will have breaks or holes at those <m>x</m>-values where it is undefined.
</p>

<example><statement>
	<p>
		Investigate the graph of <m>f(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{2}{(x - 3)^2}}</m> near <m>x = 3</m>.
	</p>
</statement><solution><p>
	This function is undefined for <m>x = 3</m>, so there is no point on the graph with <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>3</m>. However, we can make a table of values for other values of <m>x</m>. Plotting the ordered pairs in the table results in the points shown in <xref ref="fig-points-near-vertical-asymptote" text="type-global"/>.</p>

	Near a vertical asymptote, the graph of a rational function has one of the four characteristic shapes, illustrated in <xref ref="fig-4-graphs-of-rational-functions" text="type-global"/>. Locating the vertical asymptotes can help us make a quick sketch of a rational function.

<subsection><title>Horizontal Asymptotes</title>
<p>
	Look again at the graph of <m>g(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x}{x + 1}}</m> in <xref ref="example-vertical-asymptote" text="type-global"/>. As <m>\abs{x}</m> gets large—that is, as we move away from the origin along the <m>x</m>-axis in either direction—the corresponding <m>y</m>-values get closer and closer to <m>1</m>. The graph approaches, but never coincides with, the line <m>y=1</m>. We say that the graph has a <term>horizontal asymptote</term><idx>horizontal asymptote</idx> at <m>y=1</m>.
</p>
<p>
	When does a rational function <m>f(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}}</m> have a horizontal asymptote? It depends on the degrees of the two polynomials <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m>. The degree of the numerator of <m>g(x)= \displaystyle{\frac{x}{x + 1}}</m> is equal to the degree of the denominator. In other words, the highest power of <m>x</m> in the numerator (1, in this case) is the same as the highest power in the denominator.
</p>
<p>
	Consider the three rational functions whose graphs are shown in <xref ref="fig-3-cases-end-behavior" text="type-global"/>.

<p>
	<ul>
	<li>The graph of <m>r(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x + 1}{x^2}}</m> in <xref ref="fig-3-cases-end-behavior" text="type-global"/>a has a horizontal asymptote at <m>y = 0</m>, the <m>x</m>-axis, because the degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator. Higher powers of <m>x</m> grow much more rapidly than smaller powers. Thus, for large values of <m>\abs{x}</m>, the denominator is much larger in absolute value than the numerator of <m>r(x)</m>, so the function values approach <m>0</m>.</li>

	<li>The graph of <m>s(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x^2 - 4}{2x^2}}</m> in <xref ref="fig-3-cases-end-behavior" text="type-global"/>b has a horizontal asymptote at <m>y = \dfrac{1}{2}</m>, because the numerator and denominator of the fraction have the same degree. For large values of <m>\abs{x}</m>, the terms of lower degree are negligible compared to the squared terms. As <m>x</m> increases, <m>s(x)</m> is approximately equal to <m>\dfrac{x^2}{2x^2}</m>, or <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>. Thus, the function values approach a constant value of <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>.</li>

	<li>The graph of <m>t(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1}}</m> in <xref ref="fig-3-cases-end-behavior" text="type-global"/>c does not have a horizontal asymptote, because the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. As <m>\abs{x}</m> increases, <m>x^2 + 1</m> grows much faster than <m>x - 1</m>, so their ratio does not approach a constant value. The function values increase without bound.</li>
</ul>

	We summarize our discussion as follows.

	<p>
		Locate the horizontal asymptotes and sketch the graph of <m>h(x) = \displaystyle{\frac{2x^2}{x^2 + 4}}</m>.
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		The numerator and denominator of the fraction are both second-degree polynomials, so the graph does have a horizontal asymptote. The lead coefficients of <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> are <m>2</m> and <m>1</m>, respectively, so the horizontal asymptote is <m>y = \dfrac{2}{1}</m>, or <m>y=2</m>.</p>
		<p> The function <m>h</m> does not have a vertical asymptote because the denominator, <m>x^2 + 4</m>, is never equal to zero.</p>
		<p> The <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph is the point <m>(0, 0)</m>. We can plot several points by evaluating the function at convenient <m>x</m>-values, and use the asymptote to help us sketch the graph, as shown in <xref ref="fig-horizontal-asymptote-above-x-axis" text="type-global"/>.</p>

<p>
	It is often useful to simplify the formula for a rational function before using it. (See Algebra Skills Refresher <xref ref="appendix-Working-with-Algebraic-Fractions" text="type-global"/> to review operations on algebraic fractions.)
</p>

<example><statement>
	<p>
		When estimating their travel time, pilots must take into account the prevailing winds. A tailwind adds to the plane's ground speed, while a headwind decreases the ground speed. Skyhigh Airlines is setting up a shuttle service from Dallas to Phoenix, a distance of <m>800</m> miles.
		<ol label="a">
			<li><p>
				Express the time needed for a one-way trip, without wind, as a function of the speed of the plane.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Suppose there is a prevailing wind of <m>30</m> miles per hour blowing from the west. Write expressions for the flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Dallas.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Write an expression for the round-trip flying time, excluding stops, with a <m>30</m>-mile-per-hour wind from the west, as a function of the plane's speed. Simplify your expression.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		<ol label="a">
			<li><p>
				Recall that <m>\text{time} = \dfrac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}}</m>. If we let <m>r</m> represent the speed of the plane in still air, then the time required for a one-way trip is
				<me>
					f(r)=\frac{800}{r}
				</me>
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				On the trip from Dallas to Phoenix, the plane encounters a headwind of <m>30</m> miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is <m>r-30</m>. On the return trip, the plane enjoys a tailwind of <m>30</m> miles per hour, so its actual ground speed is <m>r+30</m>. Therefore, the flying times are
				<me>
					\text{Dallas to Phoenix:}\hphantom{blank}\frac{800}{r-30}
				</me>
				and
				<me>
					\text{Phoenix to Dallas:}\hphantom{blank}\frac{800}{r+30}
				</me>
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				The round-trip flying time from Dallas to Phoenix and back is
				<me>
					F(r ) =\frac{800}{r-30}+\frac{800}{r+30}
				</me>
				The LCD for these fractions is <m>(r - 30)(r + 30)</m>. Thus,
				<md>
					<mrow>
						\frac{800}{r-30}+\frac{800}{r+30} \amp= \frac{800\alert{({r+30})}}{(r-30)\alert{({r+30})}}+\frac{800\blert{({r-30})}}{(r+30)\blert{({r-30})}}
					</mrow>
					<mrow>
						\amp = \frac{(800r + 24000) + (800r - 24000)} {(r + 30)(r - 30)}
					</mrow>
					<mrow>
						\amp = \frac{1600r}{r^2 - 900}
					</mrow>
				</md>
