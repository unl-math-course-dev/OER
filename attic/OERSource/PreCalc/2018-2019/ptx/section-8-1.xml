<title>Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	Systems of linear equations are some of the most useful and widely used mathematical tools for solving problems. Systems involving hundreds of variables and equations are not uncommon in applications such as scheduling airline flights or routing telephone calls.
</p>
</introduction>
<subsection><title>Solving Systems by Graphing</title>
<p>
	A biologist wants to know the average weights of two species of birds in a wildlife preserve. She sets up a feeder whose platform is actually a scale and mounts a camera to monitor the feeder. She waits until the feeder is occupied only by members of the two species she is studying, doves and blue jays. Then she takes a picture, which records the number of each species on the scale and the total weight registered.
</p>
<p>
	From her two best pictures, she obtains the following information. The total weight of three blue jays and six doves is <m>48</m> ounces, and the total weight of five blue jays and two doves is <m>32</m> ounces. Using these data, the biologist estimates the average weight of a blue jay and of a dove. She begins by assigning variables to the two unknown quantities:
	<md>
		<mrow>
			\amp\text{Average weight of a blue jay:} ~~b			
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			\amp\text{Average weight of a dove:} ~~d			
		</mrow>
	</md>
</p>
<p>
	Because there are two variables, the biologist must write two equations about the weights of the birds. In each of the two photos,
	<me>
		(\text{weight of blue jays}) + (\text{weight of robins}) = \text{total weight}
	</me>
	Thus,
	<md alignment="alignat">
        <mrow>3b \amp {}+{} \amp  6d  {}\amp={} \amp 48</mrow>
        <mrow>5b \amp {}+{} \amp 2d  {}\amp={} \amp 32</mrow>
	</md>
</p>
<sidebyside widths="55% 35%" valigns="middle middle">
<p>
	Thus,
	<md alignment="alignat">
        <mrow>3b \amp {}+{} \amp  6d  {}\amp={} \amp 48</mrow>
        <mrow>5b \amp {}+{} \amp 2d  {}\amp={} \amp 32</mrow>
	</md>
	This pair of equations is an example of a <term>linear system</term><idx>linear system</idx> <term>of two equations in two unknowns</term> (or a <m>2\times 2</m> linear system, for short). A <term>solution</term><idx>solution</idx> to the system is an ordered pair of numbers, <m>(b, r)</m>, that satisfies both equations in the system.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-2x2-linear-system"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-2x2-linear-system" ><description>graph of two linear equations</description></image> </figure>
</sidebyside>
<p>
	Recall that every point on the graph of an equation represents a solution to that equation. A solution to <em>both</em> equations corresponds to a point on both graphs. Therefore, a solution to the system is a point where the two graphs intersect.</p>
	<p> From <xref ref="fig-2x2-linear-system" text="type-global"/>, it appears that the intersection point is <m>(4, 6)</m>, so we expect that the values <m>b=\alert{4}</m> and <m>d=\blert{6}</m> form the solution to the system. We can check by verifying that these values satisfy <em>both</em> equations in the system.
	<md>
		<mrow>
			3(\alert{4}) + 6(\blert{6})\amp\stackrel{?}{=}48 \amp\amp\text{True}
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			5(\alert{4}) + 2(\blert{6})\amp\stackrel{?}{=}32 \amp\amp\text{True}
		</mrow>
	</md>
	Both equations are true, so we conclude that the average weight of a blue jay is <m>4</m> ounces, and the average weight of a robin is <m>6</m> ounces.
</p>
<p>
	We can obtain graphs for the equations in a system quickly and easily using a calculator.

		and enter the two equations. We can see in <xref ref="fig-GC-2x2-system" text="type-global"/> that the two lines intersect in the third quadrant. We use the <c>TRACE</c> key to find the coordinates of the intersection point, <m>(-2,-3)</m>. The solution to the system is <m>x = -2</m>, <m>y=-3</m>.</p>

<note><p>
	The values we obtain from a calculator may be only approximations, so it is a good idea to check the solution algebraically. In <xref ref="example-GC-2x2-system" text="type-global"/>, we find that both equations are true when we substitute <m>x = \alert{-2}</m> and <m>y=\blert{-3}</m>.

<technology><title><!--<image source="images/icon-GC.jpg"  width="8%"><description>Graphing Calculator</description></image>-->Using the Intersect Feature to Solve a System</title>
<p>
	Because the <c>TRACE</c> feature does not show every point on a graph, we may not find the exact solution to a system by tracing the graphs.  In the next Example we demonstrate the <em>intersect</em> feature of the calculator.
</p>

<example><statement>
	<p>
		Solve the system
		<md>
			<mrow>
				3x - 2.8y \amp= 21.06
			</mrow>
			<mrow>
				2x + 1.2y \amp= 5.3
			</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		We can graph this system in the standard window by solving each equation for <m>y</m>. We enter
		<md>
			<mrow>
				Y_1\amp = (21.06 - 3X)/-2.8
			</mrow>
			<mrow>
				Y_2\amp  = (5.3 - 2X)/1.2
			</mrow>
		</md>
		and then press <c>ZOOM</c> <m>6</m>. (Do not forget the parentheses around the numerator of each expression.)</p> 
		<p> We Trace along the first line to find the intersection point. It appears to be at <m>x=4.468051</m>, <m>y =-2.734195</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-2x2-system2" text="type-global"/>a. However, if we press the up or down arrow to read the coordinates off the second line, we see that for the same <m>x</m>-coordinate we obtain a different <m>y</m>-coordinate, as in <xref ref="fig-GC-2x2-system2" text="type-global"/>b.</p> 
		<p>The different <m>y</m>-coordinates indicate that we have not found an intersection point, although we are close. The <em>intersect</em> feature can give us a better estimate, <m>x = 4.36</m>, <m>y = -2.85</m>.</p>

	Many practical problems involve two or more unknown quantities.

<example><statement>
	<p>
		A cup of rolled oats provides 11 grams of protein. A cup of rolled wheat flakes provides 8.5 grams of protein. Francine wants to combine oats and wheat to make a cereal with 10 grams of protein per cup. How much of each grain will she need in one cup of her mixture?

<subsection><title>An Application from Economics</title>
<p>
	The owner of a retail business must try to balance the demand for his product from consumers with the supply he can obtain from manufacturers. Supply and demand both vary with the price of the product: Consumers usually buy fewer items if the price increases, but manufacturers will be willing to supply more units of the product if its price increases.
</p>
<p>
	The <term>demand function</term><idx>demand function</idx> gives the number of units of the product that consumers will buy in terms of the price per unit. The <term>supply function</term><idx>supply function</idx> gives the number of units that the producer will supply in terms of the price per unit. The price at which the supply and demand are equal is called the <term>equilibrium price</term><idx>equilibrium price</idx>. This is the price at which the consumer and the producer agree to do business.
