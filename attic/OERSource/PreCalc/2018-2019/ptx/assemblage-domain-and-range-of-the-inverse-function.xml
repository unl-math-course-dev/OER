    <title>Domain and Range of the Inverse Function</title>
    <p>
        Suppose <m>f^{-1}</m> is the inverse function for <m>f</m>. Then
        <me>f^{-1}\left(f(x)\right) = x\text{ and }f\left(f^{-1}( y)\right) = y</me>
        as long as <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m>, and <m>y</m> is in the domain of <m>f^{-1}</m>.
