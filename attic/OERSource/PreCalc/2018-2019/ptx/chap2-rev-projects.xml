    <title>Projects for Chapter 2: Periodic Functions</title>

<project><title>Part I</title><p>
    A <term>periodic function</term><idx>periodic function</idx> is one whose values repeat at evenly spaced intervals, or <term>periods</term><idx>periods</idx>, of the input variable. Periodic functions are used to model phenomena that exhibit cyclical behavior, such as growth patterns in plants and animals, radio waves, and planetary motion. In this project, we consider some applications of periodic functions.

<example><statement><p>
    Which of the functions in <xref ref="fig-chap2-proj-example-1" text="type-global"/> are periodic? If the function is periodic, give its period.

    A patient receives regular doses of medication to maintain a certain level of the drug in his body. After each dose, the patient's body eliminates a certain percent of the medication before the next dose is administered. The graph shows the amount of the drug, in milliliters, in the patient's body as a function of time in hours.</p>

<project><title>Part II</title><p>
    Many periodic functions have a characteristic wave shape like the graph shown in <xref ref="fig-chap2-proj-part2" text="type-global"/>. These graphs are called <term>sinusoidal</term><idx>sinusoidal</idx>, after the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. They are often described by three parameters: the <term>period</term><idx>period</idx>, <term>midline</term><idx>midline</idx>, and <term>amplitude</term><idx>amplitude</idx>.</p>
    <p>
    The period of the graph is the smallest interval of input values on which the graph repeats. The midline is the horizontal line at the average of the maximum and minimum values of the output variable. The amplitude is the vertical distance between the maximum output value and the midline.</p>

    The apparent magnitude of a star is a measure of its brightness as seen from Earth. Smaller values for the apparent magnitude correspond to brighter stars. The graph below, called a light curve, shows the apparent magnitude of the star Algol as a function of time. Algol is an eclipsing binary star, which means that it is actually a system of two stars, a bright principal star and its dimmer companion, in orbit around each other. As each star passes in front of the other, it eclipses some of the light that reaches Earth from the system. (Source: Gamow, 1965, Brandt <ampersand /> Maran, 1972)</p>
