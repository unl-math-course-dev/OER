    <p>World3 is a computer model developed by a team of researchers at MIT. The model tracks population growth, use of resources, land development, industrial investment, pollution, and many other variables that describe human impact on the planet.</p>
    <p> The figure below is taken from <em>Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</em>. The graphs represent four possible answers to World3's core question: How may the global population and economy interact with and adapt to Earth's limited carrying capacity (the maximum it can sustain) over the coming decades?</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we examine the properties and features of some basic nonlinear functions and how they may be used as mathematical models.</p>

    <statement>
        <p>
            A contagious disease whose spread is unchecked can devastate a confined population. For example, in the early sixteenth century Spanish troops introduced smallpox into the Aztec population in Central America, and the resulting epidemic contributed significantly to the fall of Montezuma's empire.</p>
            <p> Suppose that an outbreak of cholera follows severe flooding in an isolated town of 5000 people. Initially (on Day 0), 40 people are infected. Every day after that, 25% of those still healthy fall ill.
        </p>
        <p><ol label="1">
                <li><p>At the beginning of the first day (Day 1), how many people are still healthy? <fillin characters="8" />  How many will fall ill during the first day? <fillin characters="8" /> What is the total number of people infected after the first day? <fillin characters="8" /> 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Check your results against the first two rows of the table. Subtract the total number of infected residents from 5000 to find the number of healthy residents at the beginning of the second day. Then fill in the rest of the table for 10 days. (Round off decimal results to the nearest whole number.)
