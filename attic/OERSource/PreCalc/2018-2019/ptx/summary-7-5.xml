<subsubsection><title>CONCEPTS</title>
<p>
	<ol label="1">
		<li><p>To solve an equation involving an algebraic fraction, we multiply each side of the equation by the denominator of the fraction. This has the effect of clearing the fraction, giving us an equivalent equation without fractions.</p></li>
		<li><p>Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solutions obtained are not extraneous.</p></li>
    </ol>
</p></subsubsection>

<subsubsection><title>STUDY QUESTIONS</title><p>
	<ol label="1">
		<li><p>What is the first step in solving an equation that includes algebraic fractions?</p></li>
		<li><p>If the equation also contains terms without fractions, should you multiply those terms by the LCD?</p></li>
		<li><p>What are extraneous solutions, and when might they arise?</p></li>
		<li><p>If you are solving a formula and two or more terms contain the variable you are solving for, what should you do?</p></li>
	</ol>
