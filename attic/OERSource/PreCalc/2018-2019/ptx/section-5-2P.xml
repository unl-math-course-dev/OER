    <title>Reflections and Even and Odd Functions</title>

<introduction>
   <p> In the previous section we discussed shifting a function horizontally and veritically. Now, we will take a look at what happens as we reflect a function across the <m> x</m>-axis or <m> y</m>-axis. </p>
</introduction>



<subsection><title> Reflection About y-axis</title>
    <p>
        Let <m> f(x)=(x+1)^2+1</m>, and set
        <me>
         h(x)=f(-x)=(-x+1)^2+1.
            </me>
        Compared to <m> f(x)</m>, the graph of <m>h(x)</m> is flipped, or reflected, about the <m>y</m>-axis as shown below.

<p>
    Looking at the graph and table above, we notice a relationship between the outputs of <m> f(x) </m> and <m> f(-x)</m> in this particular case, and as it so happens, this relationship holds in general.
    </p>
<p>
    Notice that if you take the column of output values for <m> f(x)</m> and flip them upside down you get the outputs of <m> f(-x)</m>. This makes sense as this is saying, for example,
    <me> f(-2)=h(\alert{2})=f(-(\alert{2}))</me>
    as <m> h(x)=f(-x)</m>. In general, we have the following definition:
    </p>
<assemblage><title>Reflection about y-axis</title>
    <p>
        Compared with the graph of <m> y=f(x)</m>, the graph of <m> f(-x)</m> is reflected about the <m>y</m>-axis.
    </p>
    
</assemblage>
    <p>
        There are some functions which do not change when we apply a reflection about the <m> y</m>-axis. The most common example of this is the function <m> y=x^2</m>. Looking at a graph of this function, it is easy to see that when you reflect it across the <m> y</m>-axis it remains unchanged. These sorts of functions have a particular name:
        </p>
    
    
    
    <assemblage><title>Even Function</title>
        <p>
           A function <m> f</m> is called an <term> even function</term> if
           <me> f(x)=f(-x)</me>
           for all <m> x </m> in the domain of <m> f </m>. In other words, a function is even if performing a reflection about the <m> y</m>-axis does not change the graph of the function.
        </p>
        
    </assemblage>
    
    <p>
        To help remember the definition of an even function, notice that the example of an even function we gave was of <m> y=x^2</m>. Other examples are <m>y= x^4 </m>, <m> y=x^6 </m>, <m>y=x^8</m>, etc. Notice that the exponent of each of these functions is an <em> even </em> number.

<subsection><title>Reflection About x-axis</title>
    <p>
        Compared to <m> y=x^2</m>, the graph of <m>h(x) = -x^2</m> is flipped, or reflected, about the <m>x</m>-axis. The <m>y</m>-coordinate of each point on the graph of <m>y = x^2</m> is replaced by its additive inverse.

   <p>
       In general, we have the following definition:
       </p>
   
   <assemblage><title>Reflection about x-axis</title>
       <p>
           Compared with the graph of <m> y=f(x)</m>, the graph of <m> -f(x)</m> is reflected about the <m>x</m>-axis.
           </p>

       </assemblage>
   
   <p>
       We now know that a function satisfying <m> f(x)=f(-x)</m> is an even function. While there do not exist any functions satisfying <m> f(x)=-f(x)</m>, we do have another type of symmetry to discuss here.
       </p>
  <example>
      <p>
          Consider the function <m> f(x)=x^3 </m>. If we reflect <m> f </m> about the <m> y </m>-axis, we get the function <m> f(-x)</m> as shown below:
            </p>
         <figure xml:id="fig-reflect-y-axis"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-reflect-y-axis.jpg"  width="40%"><description>odd function</description></image></figure>
        <p>
            If we now reflect the function <m> f(-x)</m> about the <m> x</m> axis, we can see from the above picture that we end up back with the original function. As an equation, this says
            <me> f(x)=-f(-x).</me>
            </p>
            <p>
            This type of function is said to have symmetry about the origin, or called an <em> odd function</em>.
            </p>
      </example>
  
  <assemblage><title>Odd Function</title>
      <p>
          A function <m> f</m> is called an <term> odd function</term> if
          <me> f(x)=-f(-x)</me>
          for all <m> x </m> in the domain of <m> f </m>. In other words, a function is odd if performing a reflection about the <m> y</m>-axis and <m> x</m>-axis (doesn't matter which is performed first) does not change the graph of the function.
          </p>
      </assemblage>
  <p>
      To help remember the definition of an odd function, we have a similar strategy as for even funcitons. Some examples of odd functions are <m> y=x^3</m>, <m> y=x^5</m>, <m> y=x^7 </m>, etc. Each of these examples have exponents which are odd numbers, and they are odd functions.
