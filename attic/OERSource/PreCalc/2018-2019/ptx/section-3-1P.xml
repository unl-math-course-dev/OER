<title>Exponential Functions</title>
<introduction>
    
    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Bill's parents started a college fund for Bill. When he was born they put $1,000 in a jar for Bill. Each year they add 50% of the jar's current value into the jar. Write a formula for the amount of money, A(t), in the jar when Bill is <m>t</m> years old.
            </p>
        
        </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            After 1 year, Bill's parents will add 50% of the original $1,000 into the jar. Thus, we have
            \begin{align*}
                A(1)\amp =1500\\
                \amp=1000+500\\
                \amp =1000(1)+1000(.5)\\
                \amp=\alert{1000(1.5)^1}.
        
        \end{align*}
            After 2 years, Bill's parents add %50 of the $1500 in the jar. We have
            \begin{align*}
                A(2) \amp =\alert{1000(1.5)^1}+\alert{1000(1.5)^1}(.5)\\
                \amp =\alert{1000(1.5)^1}(1.5)\\
                \amp =1000(1.5)^2.
                \end{align*}
            This trend will continue so that the amount of money in the jar after <m>t</m> years is given by the formula
            <me>
                A(t)=1000(1.5)^t.
                </me>
            </p>
        
        </solution>
    </example>
<p>
    The above example was an example of an <term>exponential function</term>. We define such a function as follows:
</p>
<assemblage><title>Exponential Function</title>
<p>
	<me>P(t) = a(b)^t \text{, where } b \gt 0 \text{ and } b \ne 1 \text{, } a \ne 0.</me>
</p>
<p>The constant <m> a </m> is the <m> y</m>-value of the <m> y</m>-intercept of the function.
</p>
</assemblage>
<p>
	Some examples of exponential functions are
	<me>f (x) = 5^x \text{, } P(t) = 250(1.7)^t \text{, and } g(n) = 2.4(0.3)^n.</me>
	The constant <m>a</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph because
	<me>f (0) = a \cdot b^0 = a \cdot 1 = a.</me>
	For the examples above, we find that the <m>y</m>-intercepts are
	\begin{align*}
	f(0) \amp= 5^0 = 1 \text{,} \\
	P(0) \amp= 250(1.7)^0 = 250\text{, and} \\
	g(0) \amp= 2.4(0.3)^0 = 2.4.
	\end{align*}
</p>
<p>
	The positive constant <m>b</m> is called the <term>base</term> of the exponential function.</p>

<p><ul>
    <li> We do not allow <m>b</m> to be negative, because if <m>b \lt 0</m>, then <m>b^x</m> is not a real number for some values of <m>x</m>. For example, if <m>b = -4</m> and <m>f (x) = (-4)^x</m>, then <m>f (1/2) = (-4)^{1/2}</m> is an imaginary number.</li>
    <li> We also exclude <m>b = 1</m> as a base because <m>1^x = 1</m> for all values of <m>x</m>; hence the function <m>f (x) = 1^x</m> is actually the constant function <m>f (x) = 1</m>.</li>
</ul>
</p>



<p>


In general, exponential functions have the following properties.

</p>
<assemblage><title>Properties of Exponential Functions, <m>f(x) = a(b)^x</m>, <m>a \gt 0</m></title><p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Domain: all real numbers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Range: all positive numbers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If <m>b \gt 1</m>, the function is increasing;</p> 
		<p>if <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, the function is decreasing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0, a)</m>. There is no <m>x</m>-intercept.</p>
	</li>
</ol></p>

    Other terms which are often used are:
    <ol>
       
        <li>
            <p>If <m>b \gt 1</m>, the function is said to have <term>exponential growth</term><idx>exponential growth</idx>.</p>
            <p>If <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, the function is said to have <term>exponential decay</term><idx>exponential decay</idx>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0, a)</m>. There is no <m>x</m>-intercept.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

<subsection><title>Exponential Equations</title>
<p>
	An <term>exponential equation</term><idx>exponential equation</idx> is one in which the variable is part of an exponent. For example, the equation
	<me>3^x = 81</me>
	is exponential. Many exponential equations can be solved by writing both sides of the equation as powers with the same base. To solve the equation above, we write
	<me>3^x = 3^4</me>
	which is true if and only if <m>x = 4</m>. In general, if two equivalent powers have the same base, then their exponents must be equal also, as long as the base is not <m>0</m> or <m>\pm 1</m>.
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes the laws of exponents can be used to express both sides of an equation as single powers of a common base.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-exponential-equations"><statement>
<p>
	Solve the following equations.
	<ol label="a">
		<li><m>3^{x-2} = 9^3</m></li>
		<li><m> 27 \cdot 3^{-2x} = 9^{x+1}</m></li>
	</ol>
</p>
</statement><solution><p>
<ol label="a">
	<li>
		Using the fact that <m>9 = 3^2</m>, we write each side of the equation as a power of <m>3</m>:
		\begin{align*}
		3^{x-2} \amp = \left(3^2\right)^3 \\
		3^{x-2} \amp = 3^6. 
		\end{align*}
		Now we equate the exponents to obtain
		\begin{align*}
		x - 2 \amp = 6 \\
		x  \amp = 8.
		\end{align*}
	</li>
	<li>
		We write each factor as a power of <m>3</m>.
		<me>3^3 \cdot 3^{-2x} = \left(3^2\right)^{x+1}</me>
		We use the laws of exponents to simplify each side:
		<me>3^{3-2x} = 3^{2x+2}.</me>
		Now we equate the exponents to obtain
		\begin{align*}
		3 - 2x \amp = 2x + 2 \\
		-4x =\amp  -1.
		\end{align*}
		The solution is <m>x = \dfrac{1}{4}</m>.
