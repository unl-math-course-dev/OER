<introduction>
    
<p> </p>

<p>
    In <xref first='sine-and-cosine' last='tangent-and-cofunctions' text='global'>Sections</xref>, we evaluated trigonometric functions at various angles, but what if we need to know what angle yields a specific sine, cosine, or tangent value. To find angles, we need inverse trigonometric functions.</p>

<example xml:id='quad-example'>
    <statement>
        <p>
            If <m>\cos(\theta)=-0.4</m>, in which quadrants can <m>\theta</m> lie? </p> </statement>
    <solution>
        <p> Since our cosine value is negative and cosine corresponds to the <m>x</m> coordinate of a point on the unit circle, <m>\theta</m> could lie in Quadrant II or Quadrant III. </p>

<p>
	In the previous example, we were given a trigonometric value and could use the definition of cosine to determine the quadrants in which <m>\theta</m> could lie. However, in order to solve for <m>\theta</m>, we need an additional tool. </p>

</exercise>

<p>
	In the previous examples and exercises, we were able to use the unit circle to solve for <m>\theta</m>, but if we are given trigonometric values that do not correspond to common angles on the unit circle, we will need to use a calculator to find approximate values for <m>\theta</m>. </p>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Find two angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> such that <m>\cos(\theta)=-0.4</m>. </p> </statement>
    <solution>
    	<p> 
        	Let's start by drawing a picture and labeling the known information and the angles we are trying to find. </p>
        <p>
        	Since we are given a cosine value, we know that we are looking for angles with an <m>x</m> coordinate of <m>-0.4</m> on the unit circle. Below is a sketch showing two angles that correspond to <m>\cos(\theta) = -0.4</m>. Recall back to <xref ref='quad-example' /> that these two angles lie in Quadrant II and Quadrant III since our cosine value is negative.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <sidebyside width='70%'><image source="imagesChap13/quadexample.png"><description>unit circle with cos(theta)=-0.4</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>
        	Since <m>x=-0.4</m> does not correspond to a common angle on the unit circle, we need to use a calculator to solve for an approximate value of <m>\theta</m>. Applying the inverse cosine function we get that
        	<me>\theta = \cos^{-1}(-0.4)</me> To evaluate this, we can use our calculator. Since the output of the inverse function is an angle, our calculator will give us an angle in degrees if it is in <term>degree mode</term> or an angle in radians if it is in <term>radian mode</term>. </p>
        <p>
        	Here, we need to decide whether to provide our answer in degrees or radians. Since we are given the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m>, which is radians, we will provide our answers in radians. Using our calculator in <term>radian mode</term> we get that 
        	<me>\theta \approx 1.982 \text{ radians}</me>
        	We have now found one angle in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> such that <m>\cos(\theta) = -0.4</m>. However, as shown above, <m>\theta</m> could lie in either Quadrant II or Quadrant III. Since 1.982 is bigger than <m>\pi/2 \approx 1.571</m> and smaller than <m>\pi \approx 3.142</m>, we know that <m>\theta=1.982</m> lies in Quadrant II. Therefore, we have found the angle shown below. </p>
        <sidebyside width='70%'><image source="imagesChap13/cos4example1.png"><description>unit circle with cos(theta)=-0.4 and only one angle shown</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>
        	We can now use symmetry to find a second angle in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> such that <m>\cos(\theta) = -0.4</m>. From our work in <xref ref='quad-example' />, we know this angle should be located in Quadrant III. By symmetry, we also know that the two angles shown below are equal. </p>
        <sidebyside width='70%'><image source="imagesChap13/cos4example2.png"><description>unit circle with cos(theta)=-0.4 and symmetry of two angles shown</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>
        	Therefore, to find the second angle, we can take the first angle we found and subtract it from <m>2\pi</m>. This gives us an angle of
        	<me>\theta \approx 2\pi - 1.982 \approx 4.301 \text{ radians}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	Thus, the two angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> that satisfy <m>\cos(\theta) = -0.4</m> are
        <me> \theta \approx 1.982 \text{ radians} \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} \theta \approx 4.301 \text{ radians}</me></p>
        <sidebyside width='70%'><image source="imagesChap13/cos4example3.png"><description>unit circle with cos(theta)=-0.4 and two angles labeled</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>
        	An easy way to check our solutions is to evaluate <m>\cos(1.982)</m> and <m>\cos(4.301)</m> on our calculators. If our calculator returns values close to <m>-0.4</m>, then we know the angles we have found are correct. Using our calculator (in radian mode), we get
        	<me>\cos(1.982)=-0.3997 \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} \cos(4.301)=-0.3999</me>
        	Since both of these values are very close and round to -0.4, we can be confident that we have found the two angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> that satisfy <m>\cos(\theta)=-0.4</m>. </p>

    <statement>
        <p>
            Find two angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> such that <m>\sin(\theta)=0.65</m>. </p> </statement>
    <solution>
		<p> 
        	Let's start by drawing a picture and labeling the known information and the angles we are trying to find. </p>
       <p>
        	Since we are given a sine value, we know that we are looking for angles with an <m>y</m> coordinate of <m>0.65</m> on the unit circle. Below is a sketch showing two angles that correspond to <m>\sin(\theta) = 0.65</m>. Note that these two angles lie in Quadrant I and Quadrant II since our sine value is positive.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <sidebyside width='70%'><image source="imagesChap13/sin65example1.png"><description>unit circle with sin(theta)=0.65</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>
        	Since <m>y=0.65</m> does not correspond to a common angle on the unit circle, we need to use a calculator to solve for an approximate value of <m>\theta</m>. Applying the inverse sine function we get that
        	<me>\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.65)</me>
        	Using our calculator in <term>radian mode</term> we get that 
        	<me>\theta \approx 0.708 \text{ radians}</me>
        	We have now found one angle in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> such that <m>\sin(\theta) = 0.65</m>. However, as shown above, <m>\theta</m> could lie in either Quadrant I or Quadrant II. Since 0.708 is bigger than 0 and smaller than <m>\pi/2 \approx 1.571</m>, we know that <m>\theta=0.708</m> lies in Quadrant I. Therefore, we have found the angle shown below. </p>

        <p>
        	Therefore, to find the second angle, we can take the first angle we found and subtract it from <m>\pi</m>. This gives us an angle of
        	<me>\theta \approx \pi - 0.708 \approx 2.434 \text{ radians}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	Thus, the two angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> that satisfy <m>\sin(\theta) = 0.65</m> are
        <me> \theta \approx 0.708 \text{ radians} \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} \theta \approx 2.434 \text{ radians}</me></p>

        <p>
        	Before we move on, let's check our solutions by evaluating <m>\sin(0.708)</m> and <m>\sin(2.434)</m> on our calculators. If our calculator returns values close to <m>0.65</m>, then we know the angles we have found are correct. Using our calculator (in radian mode), we get
        	<me>\sin(0.708)=0.6503 \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} \sin(2.434)=0.6500</me>
        	Since both of these values are very close to 0.65, we can be confident that we have found the two angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> that satisfy <m>\sin(\theta)=0.65</m>. </p>
        	</solution>
</example>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Find all angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> such that <m>\tan(\theta)=7</m>. </p> </statement>
    <solution>
		<p>
        	Since we are given a tangent value, we know that we are looking for angles where <m>y/x=7</m> on the unit circle. In addition, our tangent value is positive, so this means that <m>\theta</m> must lie in Quadrant I, where both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are positive, or in Quadrant III, where both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are negative. </p>
        <p>
        	Since <m>\tan(\theta)=7</m> does not correspond to a common angle on the unit circle, we need to use a calculator to solve for an approximate value of <m>\theta</m>. Applying the inverse tangent function we get that
        	<me>\theta = \tan^{-1}(7)</me>
        	Using our calculator in <term>radian mode</term> we get that 
        	<me>\theta \approx 1.429 \text{ radians}</me>
        	We have now found one angle in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> such that <m>\tan(\theta) = 7</m>. However, from our work above, we know that <m>\theta</m> could lie in either Quadrant I or Quadrant III. Since 1.429 is bigger than 0 and smaller than <m>\pi/2 \approx 1.571</m>, we know that <m>\theta=1.429</m> lies in Quadrant I. Therefore, we have found the angle shown below. </p>
        <sidebyside width='70%'><image source="imagesChap13/tan7example1.png"><description>unit circle with tan(theta)=7 and only one angle shown</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>
        	We can now use our knowledge of the tangent function to find a second angle in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> such that <m>\tan(\theta) = 7</m>. From our work above, we know this angle should be located in Quadrant III, and from <xref ref='tangent-and-cofunctions' />, we know that the period of tangent is <m>\pi</m>. Therefore, the other angle where <m>\tan(\theta)=7</m> should be located halfway around the unit circle from our first value. </p>
        <sidebyside width='70%'><image source="imagesChap13/tan7example2.png"><description>unit circle with tan(theta)=7 and two angles shown</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>
        	To find this second angle, we can add <m>\pi</m> to the first angle we found, which gives us an angle of
        	<me>\theta \approx 1.429 + \pi \approx 4.570 \text{ radians}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	Thus, the two angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> that satisfy <m>\tan(\theta) = 7</m> are
        <me> \theta \approx 1.429 \text{ radians} \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} \theta \approx 4.570 \text{ radians}</me></p>

        <p>
        	Before we move on, let's check our solutions by evaluating <m>\tan(1.429)</m> and <m>\tan(4.570)</m> on our calculators. If our calculator returns values close to <m>7</m>, then we know the angles we have found are correct. Using our calculator (in radian mode), we get
        	<me>\tan(1.429)=7.005 \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} \tan(4.570)=6.975</me>
        	Since both of these values are very close to 7, we can be confident that we have found the two angles in the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> that satisfy <m>\tan(\theta)=7</m>. </p>
        	</solution>

	Using inverse trig functions, we can also solve for the angles of a right triangle given two of its sides. </p>

        <p>
