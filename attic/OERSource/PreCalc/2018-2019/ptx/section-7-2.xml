<title>Graphing Polynomial Functions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	In <xref ref="Polynomial-Functions" text="type-global"/>, we considered applications of polynomial functions. Although most applications use only a portion of the graph of a particular polynomial, we can learn a lot about these functions by taking a more global view of their behavior.
</p>
</introduction>
<subsection><title>Classifying Polynomials by Degree</title>
<p>
	The graph of a polynomial function depends first of all on its degree. We have already studied the graphs of polynomials of degrees <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>2</m>.</p> 
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>A polynomial of degree <m>0</m> is a constant, and its graph is a horizontal line. An example of such a polynomial function is <m>f(x) = 3</m> (see <xref ref="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials" text="type-global"/>a).</li>
			<li> A polynomial of degree <m>1</m> is a linear function, and its graph is a straight line. The function <m>f(x) = 2x - 3</m> is an example of a polynomial of degree <m>1</m>. (See <xref ref="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials" text="type-global"/>b.)</li>
		</ul></p>
	<figure xml:id="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials"  width="70%"><description>horizontal line and line of nonzero slope</description></image></figure>

<p>
	Quadratic functions, such as <m>f(x) = -2x^2 + 6x + 8</m>, are polynomials of degree <m>2</m>. The graph of every quadratic function is a parabola, with the same basic shape as the standard parabola, <m>y = x^2</m>. (See <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas2" text="type-global"/>.) It has one turning point, where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. The turning point of a parabola is the same as its vertex.</p>

</subsection>




<subsection><title>Cubic Polynomials</title>

<p>
	Do the graphs of all <term>cubic</term><idx>cubic</idx>, or third-degree, polynomials have a basic shape in common? We can graph a few examples and find out. Unlike the basic parabola, the graph of <m>y = x^3</m> is always increasing. At the origin, however, it changes from concave down to concave up. A point where the graph changes concavity is called an <term>inflection point</term><idx>inflection point</idx>.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-two-cubics"><statement>
	<p>
		Graph the cubic polynomial <m>P(x) = x^3 - 4x</m> and compare its graph with that of the basic cubic, <m>y = x^3</m>.
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		The graph of the basic cubic is shown in <xref ref="fig-two-cubics" text="type-global"/>a. To help us understand the graph of the polynomial <m>P(x) = x^3 - 4x</m>, we will evaluate the function to make a table of values. We can do this by hand or use the Table feature on the graphing calculator.</p>

		<p>The graph of <m>P(x) = x^3 - 4x</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig-two-cubics" text="type-global"/>b. It is not exactly the same shape as the basic cubic—it has two turning points—but it is similar, especially at the edges of the graphs.
	</p>
</solution></example>

<p>
	Despite the differences in the central portions of the two graphs, they exhibit similar <em>long-term</em> behavior. 
	<ul>
		<li>For very large and very small values of <m>x</m>, both graphs look like the power function <m>y = x^3</m>.</li>
		<li> The <m>y</m>-values increase from <m>-\infty</m> toward zero in the third quadrant, and they increase from zero toward <m>+\infty</m> in the first quadrant. Or we might say that the graphs start at the lower left and extend to the upper right.</li>
		</ul> 
	All cubic polynomials display this behavior when their lead coefficients (the coefficient of the <m>x^3</m> term) are positive.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Both of the graphs in <xref ref="example-two-cubics"/> are smooth curves without any breaks or holes. This smoothness is a feature of the graphs of all polynomial functions.</li>
		<li> The domain of any polynomial function is the entire set of real numbers.</li>
	</ul>

	Another way to describe the long-term behavior of a polynomial graph is to note that for large values of <m>\abs{x}</m>, the shape is similar to a power function of the same degree. It is the presence of the lower-degree terms in the polynomial that are responsible for any extra wiggles or turning points in the graph.

<subsection><title><m>x</m>-Intercepts and the Factor Theorem</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="chap6" text="type-global"/>, we saw that the x-intercepts of a quadratic polynomial, <m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m>, occur at values of <m>x</m> for which <m>f(x) = 0</m>, that is, at the real-valued solutions of the equation <m>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m>. The same holds true for polynomials of higher degree.
</p>
<p>
	Solutions of the equation <m>P(x) = 0</m> are called <term>zeros</term> of the polynomial <m>P</m>. In <xref ref="example-two-cubics" text="type-global"/>, we graphed the cubic polynomial <m>P(x) = x^3 - 4x</m>. Its <m>x</m>-intercepts are the solutions of the equation <m>x^3 - 4x = 0</m>, which we can solve by factoring the polynomial <m>P(x)</m>.
	<md>
		<mrow>
			x^3 - 4x \amp= 0
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			x(x - 2)(x + 2) \amp= 0
		</mrow>
	</md>
	The zeros of <m>P</m> are <m>0</m>, <m>2</m>, and <m>-2</m>. Each zero of <m>P</m> corresponds to a factor of <m>P(x)</m>. This result suggests the following theorem, which holds for any polynomial <m>P</m>.
</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-factor-theorem.xml" />

<p>
	The factor theorem follows from the division algorithm for polynomials. We will consider both of these results in more detail in the Homework problems.
</p>
<p>
	Because a polynomial function of degree <m>n</m> can have at most <m>n</m> linear factors of the form <m>(x - a)</m>, it follows that <m>P</m> can have at most <m>n</m> distinct zeros.</p> 
	<p>Another way of saying this is that if <m>P(x)</m> is a polynomial of <m>n</m>th degree, the equation <m>P(x) = 0</m> can have at most <m>n</m> distinct solutions, some of which may be complex numbers. (We consider complex numbers in <xref ref="Complex-Numbers" text="type-global"/>.)</p> 
	<p>Because only real-valued solutions appear on the graph as <m>x</m>-intercepts, we have the following corollary to the factor theorem.
</p>

<assemblage><title><m>x</m>-Intercepts of Polynomials</title>
<p>
	A polynomial of degree <m>n</m> can have at most <m>n</m> <m>x</m>-intercepts.
</p></assemblage>

<p>
	If some of the zeros of <m>P</m> are complex numbers, they will not appear on the graph, so a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> <em>may have fewer</em> than <m>n</m> <m>x</m>-intercepts.

<subsection><title>Zeros of Multiplicity Two or Three</title>
<p>
	The appearance of the graph near an <m>x</m>-intercept is determined by the multiplicity of the zero there. For example, both real zeros of the polynomial <m>g(x) = x^4 - 3x^2 - 4</m> in <xref ref="example-cubic-and-quartic" text="type-global"/>b are of multiplicity one, and the graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at each intercept.</p> 
	<p>However, the polynomial <m>f(x) = x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x</m> in <xref ref="example-cubic-and-quartic" text="type-global"/>a has a zero of multiplicity two at <m>x = -3</m>. The graph of <m>f</m> just touches the <m>x</m>-axis and then reverses direction without crossing the axis.
</p>
<p>
	To understand what happens in general, compare the graphs of the three polynomials in <xref ref="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" text="type-global"/>.</p>
	<figure xml:id="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero"><description>plots of a linear, quadratic, and cubic, each with a single zero</description></image></figure>
	<p><ol label="*a*">
		<li><p>
			In <xref ref="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" text="type-global"/>a, <m>L(x) = x - 2</m> has a zero <em>of multiplicity one</em> at <m>x = 2</m>, and its graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis there.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>

<p>
	Near its <m>x</m>-intercepts, the graph of a polynomial takes one of the characteristic shapes illustrated in <xref ref="fig-linear-quadratic-and-cubic-with-1-zero" text="type-global"/>.</p> 
	<note><p>Although we will not consider zeros of multiplicity greater than three, they correspond to similar behavior in the graph: At a zero of odd multiplicity, the graph has an inflection point at the intercept; its graph makes an S-shaped curve. At a zero of even multiplicity, the graph has a turning point; it changes direction without crossing the <m>x</m>-axis.</p></note>


<example><statement>
	<p>
		Graph the polynomial
		<me>
			f(x) = (x + 2)^3(x - 1)(x - 3)^2
		</me>
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		The polynomial has degree six, an even number, so its graph starts at the upper left and extends to the upper right. Its <m>y</m>-intercept is 
		<me>f(0) = (2)^3(-1)(-3)^2 = -72</me> 
		<m>f</m> has a zero of multiplicity three at <m>x = -2</m>, a zero of multiplicity one at <m>x = 1</m>, and a zero of multiplicity two at <m>x = 3</m>. The graph has an S-shaped curve at <m>x = -2</m>, crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>x = 1</m>, touches the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>x = 3</m>, and then changes direction, as shown in <xref ref="fig-sixth-degree-polynomial" text="type-global"/>.</p>
