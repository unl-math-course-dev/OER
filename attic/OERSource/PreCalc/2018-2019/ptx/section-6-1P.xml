<title>Intro to Quadratic Functions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	In this chapter, we shall define a quadratic function and what information each way of writing such a function presents to the reader. It should be noted that the shape of the graph of a quadratic function is called a <term> parabola</term>.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Quadratic Function</title>
    <p>
 A <term> quadratic function</term> is one that can be written in the form
 <me> f(x)=ax^2+bx+c </me>
 where <m> a,b,</m> and <m> c</m> are constants with <m> a\neq 0</m>.
 </p>
    <p>
        When a quadratic function is written in this form, we say that the quadratic function is written in <term> standard form </term>.
    </p>
    </assemblage>
<p>
	In the definition above, notice that if <m>a</m> is zero, there is no <m>x</m>-squared term, so the function is not quadratic (it would then be linear).
</p>
<p>
	Suppose that the height of a baseball <m>t</m> seconds after being hit is given by
	<me>h = -16t^2 + 64t + 4.</me>
	How can we find two times when the baseball is <m>64</m> feet high? 
</p>
<p>
	We are looking for values of <m>t</m> that produce <m>h = 64</m> in the height equation. So, if we substitute <m>h = 64</m> into the height equation, we need to solve the <term>quadratic equation</term>
	<me>64 = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
	This equation cannot be solved by extraction of roots, because there are two terms containing the variable <m>t</m>, and they cannot be combined. To solve this equation, we will appeal to a property of our number system, called the <term>zero-factor principle</term>.
</p>
</introduction>














<subsection><title>Zero-Factor Principle</title>
<p>
	Can you multiply two numbers together and obtain a product of zero? Only if one of the two numbers happens to be zero. This property of numbers is called the <term>zero-factor principle</term>.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Zero-Factor Principle</title>
    <p>
      The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one or both of the factors equals zero. In symbols,
      <me>ab=0\ \ \text{if and only if}\ \ a=0\ \ or\ \ b=0.  </me>
        </p>
    </assemblage>

<p>
	The principle is true even if the numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are represented by algebraic expressions, such as <m>x - 5</m> or <m>2x + 1</m>. For example, if
	<me>(x - 5)(2x + 1) = 0</me>
	then it must be true that either <m>x - 5 = 0</m> or <m>2x + 1 = 0</m>. Thus, we can use the zero-factor principle to solve equations.
</p>

<example><statement>
<p>
	<ol label="a">
		<li>
			Solve the equation <m>(x - 6)(x + 2) = 0</m>.
		</li>
		<li>
		Find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2 - 4x - 12</m>.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
</statement><solution><p>
	<ol label="a">
		<li><p>
			We apply the zero-factor principle to the product <m>(x - 6)(x + 2)</m>.</p>

				<cell><m>x =6</m></cell>
				<cell>	or</cell>	
				<cell><m>x=-2</m></cell>
			</row>
			</tabular></sidebyside>
			<p>There are two solutions, <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>. (You should check that both of these values satisfy the original equation.)</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>
			To find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph, we set <m>y = 0</m> and solve the equation 
			<me>0 = x^2 - 4x - 12</me>
			But this is the equation we solved in part (a), because <m>(x - 6)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4x - 12</m>.
			The solutions of that equation were <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>, so the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph are <m>(6,0)</m> and <m>(-2,0)</m>. You can see this by using a graphing utility, as shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-parab-with-x-intercepts" text="type-global"/>.</p>

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring</title>
<p>
	Before we apply the zero-factor principle to solve a quadratic equation, we must first write the equation so that one side of the equation is zero. Let us introduce some terminology.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Forms for Quadratic Equations</title>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			 A quadratic equation written
			 <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me>
			 is in <term>standard form</term><idx>standard form</idx>.
		</li>
		<li>
			A quadratic equation written 
			<me>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</me>
			 is in <term>factored form</term><idx>factored form</idx>.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p></assemblage>

<p>
	Once we have written the equation in standard form, we factor the left side and set each variable factor equal to zero separately.
</p>

<example><statement>
	<p>
		Solve <m>3x(x + 1) = 2x + 2</m>.
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		First, we write the equation in standard form.
		\begin{align*}
		3x(x + 1) \amp = 2x + 2\amp\amp\text{Apply the distributive law to the left side.}\\
		3x^2 + 3x \amp = 2x + 2\amp\amp\text{Subtract }2x + 2 \text{ from both sides.}\\
		3x^2 + x - 2 \amp = 0
		\end{align*}
		Next, we factor the left side to obtain
		<me>(3x - 2)(x + 1) = 0.</me>
		We then apply the zero-factor principle by setting each factor equal to zero.
		<me>3x - 2 =0 ~~\text{ or }~~ x + 1 = 0</me>
		Finally, we solve each equation to find
		<me>x = \frac{2}{3} ~~\text{ or }~~ x = -1.</me>
		The solutions are <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> and <m>-1</m>.
	</p>
</solution>
</example>

<warning><title></title><p>
	When we apply the zero-factor principle, one side of the equation must be zero. For example, to solve the equation
	<me>(x - 2)(x - 4) = 15</me>
	it is incorrect to set each factor equal to <m>15</m>! (There are many ways that the product of two numbers can equal <m>15</m>; it is not necessary that one of the numbers be <m>15</m>.) We must first simplify the left side and write the equation in standard form. (The correct solutions are <m>7</m> and <m>-1</m>; make sure you can find these solutions.)
</p></warning>

<p>
	We summarize the factoring method for solving quadratic equations as follows.

</exercise>

<p>
	We can use factoring to solve the equation
    <me> 64=-16t^2+64t+4</me>
    from the beginning of the section.
</p>

<example><statement>
	<p>
		The height, <m>h</m>, of a baseball <m>t</m> seconds after being hit is given by
		<me>h = -16t^2 + 64t + 4.</me>
		When will the baseball reach a height of <m>64</m> feet?
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		We substitute <m>64</m> for <m>h</m> in the formula, and solve for <m>t</m>.
		\begin{align*}
		64 = -16t^2 + 64t \amp + 4\amp\amp\text{Write the equation in standard form.}\\
		16t^2 - 64t + 60 \amp= 0\amp\amp\text{Factor 4 from the left side.}\\
		4(4t^2 - 16t + 15) \amp= 0\amp\amp\text{Factor the quadratic expression.}\\
		4(2t - 3)(2t - 5) \amp= 0\amp\amp\text{Set each variable factor equal to zero.}\\
		2t - 3 =0 ~~\text{ or }~~ 2t - 5 \amp= 0\amp\amp\text{Solve each equation.}\\
		t = \frac{3}{2}  ~~\text{ or }~~  t \amp = \frac{5}{2}
		\end{align*}
		There are two solutions to the quadratic equation. At <m>t = \dfrac{3}{2}</m> seconds, the ball reaches a height of <m>64</m> feet on the way up, and at <m>t = \dfrac{5}{2}</m> seconds, the ball is <m>64</m> feet high on its way down. (See <xref ref="fig-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>.)</p>

</solution>
</example>

<note><p>
	In the solution to the above exercise, the factor <m>4</m> does not affect the solutions of the equation at all. You can understand why this is true by looking at some graphs. First, check that the two equations
	<me>x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 ~~\text{ and }~~ 4(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0</me>
	have the same solutions, <m>x = 1</m> and <m>x = 3</m>. Then use your graphing calculator to graph the equation
	<me>Y_1 = X^2 - 4X + 3</me>
	in the window
	    \begin{align}
        \text{Xmin} \amp = -2 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 8\\
        \text{Ymin} \amp = -5 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 10.
        \end{align}
       Notice that when <m>y = 0</m>, <m>x = 3</m> or <m>x = 1</m>. These two points are the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph. In the same window, now graph
       <me>Y_2 = 4(X^2 - 4X + 3).</me>
       (See <xref ref="fig-GC-scaled-parabola" text="type-global"/>.) This graph has the same <m>x</m>-values when <m>y = 0</m>. The factor of <m>4</m> stretches the graph vertically but does not change the location of the <m>x</m>-intercepts. The value of the constant factor <m>a</m> in the factored form of a quadratic function, <m>f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)</m>, does not affect the location of the <m>x</m>-intercepts, because it does not affect the solutions of the equation <m>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</m>.</p>
