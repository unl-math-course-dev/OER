<subsection><title>Compounding Once a Year</title>
<p>
    If the interest on a savings account is compounded annually, the amount of money in the account grows exponentially.
</p>
<p>
    Consider a principal of <dollar/>100 invested at 5<percent/> interest compounded annually. At the end of <m>1</m> year, the amount is
    \begin{align*}
    \text{Amount} \amp = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \\
    A \amp = P + Pr\\
    \amp = 100 + 100(0.05) = 105.
    \end{align*}
    It will be more useful to write the formula for the amount after <m>1</m> year in factored form.
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P + Pr \amp\amp \text{Factor out P.} \\
    \amp = P(1 + r)
    \end{align*}
    With this version of the formula, the calculation for the amount at the end of <m>1</m> year looks like this:
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P(1 + r ) \\
    \amp = 100(1 + 0.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05) = \alert{105}.
    \end{align*}
</p>
<p>
    The amount, <dollar/>105, becomes the new principal for the second year. To find the amount at the end of the second year, we apply the formula again, with <m>P = 105</m>.
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P(1 + r ) \\
    \amp = 105(1 + 0.05) \\
    \amp = \alert{105}(1.05) = 110.25.
    \end{align*}
    Observe that to find the amount at the end of each year, we multiply the principal by a factor of <m>1 + r = 1.05</m>. Thus, we can express the amount at the end of the second year as
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = [100(1.05)](1.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05)^2
    \end{align*}
    and at the end of the third year as
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = \left[100(1.05)^2\right](1.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05)^3.
    \end{align*}
</p>
<sidebyside>
<p>
    At the end of each year, we multiply the old balance by another factor of <m>1.05</m> to get the new amount. We organize our results into <xref ref="table-percent-increase" text="type-global"/>, where <m>A(t)</m> represents the amount of money in the account after <m>t</m> years. For this example, a formula for the amount after <m>t</m> years is
    <me>A(t) = 100(1.05)^t.</me>

<p>
    In general, for an initial investment of <m>P</m> dollars at an interest rate <m>r</m> compounded annually, we have the following formula for the amount accumulated after <m>t</m> years.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Annual Interest</title><idx>annual interest</idx>
    <p>
        The amount, A(t), accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded annually is
        <me>A(t) = a(1 + r)^t</me>
        where
        \begin{align*}
        \amp a \amp\amp \text{is the principal invested,} \\
        \amp r \amp\amp \text{is the effective annual interest rate,} \\
        \amp t \amp\amp \text{is the time period, in years,}\\
        \amp b=1+r \amp\amp \text{is the growth factor.}
        \end{align*}
    </p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    This function describes exponential growth with an initial value of <m>P</m> and a growth factor of <m>b = 1 + r</m>. The interest rate <m>r</m>, which indicates the <term>percent increase</term><idx>percent increase</idx> in the account each year, corresponds to a <term>growth factor</term><idx>growth factor</idx> of <m>1 + r</m>. The notion of percent increase is often used to describe the growth factor for quantities that grow exponentially.

<subsection><title>Compounding <m>n</m>-Times a Year</title>
    <p>
        If we have a principal of <m>P</m> and an interest rate <m>r</m>, then by compounding this interest rate <m>n</m>-times a year we mean the following:
        <p>
            Rather than apply the interest rate <m>r</m> one time over the course of a year, we instead apply an interest of <m> \dfrac{r}{n}</m> a total of <m>n</m> times over the course of the year.
            </p>
        </p>
    
    
    <assemblage><title>Compound Interest</title><idx>compound interest</idx>
        <p>
            The <term>amount A(t)</term> accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded n-times a year is
            <me>A(t) = P(1 + \dfrac{r}{n})^{nt}</me>
            where
            \begin{align*}
            \amp P \amp\amp \text{is the principal invested,} \\
            \amp r \amp\amp \text{is the nominal interest rate,} \\
             \amp n \amp\amp \text{is the number of times the interest is compounded,} \\
            \amp t \amp\amp \text{is the time period, in years.}
            \end{align*}

    <warning>
        <p>
            The growth factor of
            <me>
                A(t) = P(1 + \dfrac{r}{n})^{nt}
            </me>
            is not <m> 1+\dfrac{r}{n}</m>. Recall that when a function is written in the form <m> P(b)^t </m> the growth factor is <m> b</m>. So, we need to rewrite our function in this form. We do this as follows:
            <me>
            A(t)=P(1 + \dfrac{r}{n})^{nt} = P[(1+\dfrac{r}{n})^n]^t.
            </me>
            If we set
            <me>
                b=(1+\dfrac{r}{n})^n,
                </me>
                    then we have rewritten <m> A(t)</m> in the form <m> P(b)^t</m>, and thus the growth factor is
                    <me>(1+\dfrac{r}{n})^n.</me>
                </p>

    <example xml:id="example-inflation"><statement>
        <p>
            During a period of rapid inflation, prices of a pound of butter rose by <m>24</m><percent/> compounded twice a year. At the beginning of the inflationary period, a pound of butter cost <dollar/><m>2</m>.
            <ol label="a">
                <li><p>Write a function that gives the price of a pound of butter <m>t</m> years after inflation began.</p></li>
                <li><p>How much did a pound of butter cost after <m>3</m> years? After <m>15</m> months?</p></li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement><solution><p>
        <ol label="a">
            <li><p> Looking at our compound interest formula
                <me>  A(t) = P(1 + \dfrac{r}{n})^{nt}, </me>
                we know that we are compounding twice a year, so <m> n=2</m>, and the nominal rate is <m>24</m><percent/>, so <m> r=.24</m>. The problem also tells us the original price of a pound of butter was <dollar/><m>2</m>, so <m> P=2</m>. Using this information, we get the formula
                <me> A(t) = 2(1 + \dfrac{.24}{2})^{2t}= 2(1.12)^{2t}.</me>
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li><p>To find the price of butter at any time after inflation began, we evaluate the function at the appropriate value of <m>t</m>.
                \begin{align*}
                P(\alert{3}) \amp = 2(1.12)^{2(\alert{3})} \\
                \amp = 2(1.12)^6 \approx 3.95
                \end{align*}
                After <m>3</m> years, the price was <dollar/><m>3.95</m>. Fifteen months is <m>1.25</m> years, so we evaluate <m>P(1.25)</m>.
                \begin{align*}
                P(\alert{1.25}) \amp = 2(1.12)^{2(\alert{1.25})} \\
                \amp = 2(1.12)^{2.5} \approx 2.66
                \end{align*}
                After <m>15</m> months, the price of butter was <dollar/><m>2.66</m>.
            </p></li>
            
        </ol>
    </p></solution>
    </example>
    
    <p>
        In <xref ref="example-inflation" text="type-global"/>, we can rewrite the formula for <m>P(t)</m> as follows:
        \begin{align*}
        P(t)\amp = 2(1.12)^{2t} \\
        \amp = 2\left[(1.12)^2\right]^t = 2(1.2544)^t.
        \end{align*}
        Thus, the annual growth factor for the price of butter is <m>1.2544</m>, and the annual percent growth rate, or effective annual rate, is <m>25.44</m><percent/>.
