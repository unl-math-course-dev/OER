<title>Combining Transformations</title>
<introduction>
    <p>Nearing the end of this section, we have now discussed several tranformations which can be performed on a function. Since we now have a solid grasp on each of these transformations, let's apply multiple transformations to a function and study the
    outcome.
    </p>
    </introduction>
<subsection><title>Order Matters</title>
<p>
   In the previous section we looked at the image below where <m> f(x)=(x-1)^2</m>.
  <figure xml:id="fig-horiz-comp"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-horiz-comp.jpg"  width="50%"><description>yHorizontal Compression</description></image></figure>
  Note that since <m> f(x)=(x-1)^2</m>, the function <m> x^2 </m> shifted to the right by <m> 1 </m>. As we know from the last section, <m> f(2x)</m> is a horizontal compression by a factor of <m> 2 </m>.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, the function <m> f(2x)=(2x-1)^2</m> is the result of starting with <m> x^2</m> and applying
    <ol>
        <li> horizontal shift right by <m> 1</m>
        </li>
        
        <li> horizontal compression by a factor of <m> 2 </m>
        </li>
    </ol>
    in this order.
    </p>

<p>
    Now, what happens if we start with <m> x^2</m> and start with a horizontal compression by a factor of 2 (shown below in red) and then apply a horizontal shift right by 1 (shown below in blue).
    </p>
         <figure xml:id="fig-compress-then-shift"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-compress-then-shift.jpg"  width="50%"><description>yHorizontal Compression</description></image></figure>
        <p>
            Comparing the two results (in both pictures the final stage is in blue) it is clear that the order in which the transformations are performed is very important.

<subsection><title>Which Order to Use</title>
    <p>
        As discussed thus far, in general, the order is important with transformations. However, if the transformations are vertical and horizontal changes then it does not matter whether the horizontal or vertical transformations are handled first. In general, we can follow the following guide:
        </p>
    <assemblage><title> Order of Transformations</title>
        <p>
            Suppose that <m> f(x)</m> is our function we are applying transformations to. Once written in the form
            <me> a\cdot f(b\cdot (x+h))+k</me>
            the order of transformations is:
            </p>
            <p>
        <ol>
            <li> horizontal stretch or compress by a factor of <m> \abs{b}</m> or <m> \abs{\dfrac{1}{b}}</m> (if <m> b\lt 0</m> then also reflect about <m>y</m>-axis)
            </li>
            
            <li> shift horizontally left/ right by <m> \abs{h} </m>
            </li>
            
            <li> vertically stretch or compress by a factor of <m> \abs{a}</m> or <m> \abs{\dfrac{1}{a}}</m> (if <m> a\lt 0</m> then also reflect about <m>x</m>-axis)
            </li>
            
            <li> shift vertically up/ down by <m> \abs{k} </m>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        </assemblage>
    
    <example>
        <statement><p>
            Describe the function
            <me> 5\cdot [f(-3x-6)-1]</me>
            as a list of transformations done to <m> f(x)</m> in the appropriate order.
            
            </p>
            </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First, let's rewrite the function in the form given above:
                \begin{align*}
                5\cdot [f(-3x-6)-1]\amp = 5f(-3x-6)-5 \ \ \text{we distributed in the 5}\\
                                   \amp = 5f(-3(x+2))-5 \ \ \text{we factored out the -3}
                                   \end{align*}
                                   Now that the function is written in the desired order, we may list off the transformations in the correct order using the order discussed above:
                                   
                    <ol>
            <li> horizontal compress by <m> 3</m> and reflect about the <m> y</m>-axis
                                       </li>
                                       
    <li> shift horizontally left by <m> 2 </m>
                                       </li>
                                       
<li> vertically stretch by <m> 5</m>
                                       </li>
                                       
                <li> shift vertically down by <m> 5 </m>
                                       </li>
                                   </ol>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
