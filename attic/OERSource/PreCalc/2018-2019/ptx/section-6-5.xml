<title>Quadratic Inequalities</title>

<subsection><title>Solving Inequalities Graphically</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="chap1" text="type-global"/>, we used graphs to solve equations and inequalities. The graphing technique is especially helpful for solving quadratic inequalities.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-fireworks"><statement>
	<p>
		The Chamber of Commerce in River City plans to put on a Fourth of July fireworks display. City regulations require that fireworks at public gatherings explode higher than <m>800</m> feet above the ground. The mayor particularly wants to include the Freedom Starburst model, which is launched from the ground. Its height after t seconds is given by
		<me>h = 256t - 16t^2</me>
		When should the Starburst explode in order to satisfy the safety regulation?
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		We can get an approximate answer to this question by looking at the graph of the rocket's height, shown in <xref ref="fig-fireworks" text="type-global"/>.</p>
		<figure xml:id="fig-fireworks"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-fireworks"  width="50%"><description>graph of fireworks height</description></image> </figure>
		<p>When is the rocket's height greater than 800 feet, or, in mathematical terms, for what values of <m>t</m> is <m>h \gt 800</m>? The answer to this question is the solution of the inequality
		<me>256t - 16t^2 \gt 800</me>
		Points on the graph with <m>h \gt 800</m> are shown in color, and the <m>t</m>-coordinates of those points are marked on the horizontal axis. If the Freedom Starburst explodes at any of these times, it will satisfy the safety regulation.</p> 
		<p></p> 
		<p>From the graph, the safe time interval runs from approximately <m>4.25</m> seconds to <m>11.75</m> seconds after launch. The solution of the inequality is the set of all <m>t</m>-values greater than <m>4.25</m> but less than <m>11.75</m>.
	</p></solution></example>

<p>
	The solution set in <xref ref="example-fireworks" text="type-global"/> is called a <term>compound inequality</term><idx>compound inequality</idx>, because it involves more than one inequality symbol. We write this set as
	<me>4.25 \lt t \lt 11.75</me>
	and read "<m>t</m> greater than <m>4.25</m> but less than <m>11.75</m>."
</p>

<technology><title><!--<image source="images/icon-GC.jpg"  width="8%"><description>Graphing Calculator</description></image>-->Solving an Inequality With a Graphing Calculator</title>
<p>
	You can use your graphing calculator to solve the problem in <xref ref="example-fireworks" text="type-global"/>. Graph the two equations
	
		\begin{align}
		Y_1 \amp= 256X - 16X^2\\
		Y_2 \amp= 800
		\end{align}
	
	on the same screen. Use <c>WINDOW</c> settings to match the graph in <xref ref="fig-GC-fireworks" text="type-global"/>. Then use the intersect feature to find the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the points where the two graphs intersect (there are two of them). These points will have <m>y</m>-coordinates of <m>800</m>. The parabola is above the line, so <m>h \gt 800</m> when <m>t</m> is between these two <m>x</m>-values. To two decimal places, you can see that <m>h \gt 800</m> when <m>4.26 \lt t \lt 11.74</m>.</p>

<note><p>
	In <xref ref="example-fireworks" text="type-global"/>, we solved the inequality <m>256t - 16t^2 \gt 800</m> by comparing points on the graph of <m>h = 256 - 16t^2</m> with points on the line <m>h = 800</m>. If one side of an inequality is zero, we can compare points on the graph with the line <m>y = 0</m>, which is the <m>x</m>-axis.

	Because it is relatively easy to decide whether the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point on a graph is positive or negative (the point lies above the <m>x</m>-axis or below the x-axis), we often rewrite a given inequality so that one side is zero.

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Inequalities Algebraically</title>
<p>
	Although a graph is very helpful in solving inequalities, it is not completely necessary. Every quadratic inequality can be put into one of the forms
	<me>
		\begin{aligned}
		ax^2 + bx + c \amp\lt 0\text{,}
		\amp\hphantom{blank} ax2 + bx + c \amp\gt 0\\
		ax^2 + bx + c \amp\le 0\text{,}
		\amp\hphantom{blank} ax2 + bx + c \amp\ge 0\\
		\end{aligned}
	</me>
	All we really need to know is whether the corresponding parabola <m>y = ax^2 + bx + c</m> opens upward or downward. Consider the parabolas shown in <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas" text="type-global"/>.</p>
	<figure xml:id="fig-two-parabolas"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-two-parabolas"  width="50%"><description>one parabola opens up, the other opens down</description></image> </figure>

<p>
	The parabola in <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas" text="type-global"/>a opens upward. It crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at two points, <m>x = r_1</m> and <m>x = r_2</m>. At these points, <m>y = 0</m>. </p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The graph lies below the <m>x</m>-axis between <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>, so the solutions to the inequality <m>y\lt 0</m> lie between <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>.</p></li> 
		<li><p>The graph lies above the <m>x</m>-axis for <m>x</m>-values less than <m>r_1</m> or greater than <m>r_2</m>, so the solutions to the inequality <m>y\gt 0</m> are <m>x\lt r_1</m> or <m>x\gt r_2</m>.</p></li>
	</ul></p>
<p>
	If the parabola opens downward, as in <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas" text="type-global"/>b, the situation is reversed. The solutions to the inequality <m>y\gt 0</m> lie between the <m>x</m>-intercepts, and the solutions to <m>y\lt 0</m> lie outside the <m>x</m>-intercepts.
</p>
<p>
	From the graphs in <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas" text="type-global"/>, we see that the <m>x</m>-intercepts are the boundary points between the portions of the graph with positive <m>y</m>-coordinates and the portions with negative <m>y</m>-coordinates. To solve a quadratic inequality, we need only locate the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the corresponding graph and then decide which intervals of the <m>x</m>-axis produce the correct sign for <m>y</m>.

			<li><p>Make a rough sketch of the graph of <m>y = 16 + 6x - x^2</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-quadratic-inequality2" text="type-global"/>. Because <m>a = -1 \lt 0</m>, the graph is a parabola that opens downward.</p>

			</li>
			<li><p>We are interested in points on the graph for which <m>y\le 0</m>. The points with negative <m>y</m>-coordinates (that is, points below the <m>x</m>-axis) lie outside the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph, so the solution of the inequality is <m>x\le -2</m> or <m>x\ge 8</m>. Or, using interval notation, the solution is <m>(-\infty,-2] \cup  [8,\infty)</m>.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</solution></example>

<warning>
	<p>
		Many people think that the inequality signs in the solution should point in the same direction as the sign in the original problem, and hence would incorrectly write the solution to <xref ref="example-quadratic-inequality2" text="type-global"/> as <m>x \le -2</m> or <m>x \le 8</m>. However, you can see from the graph that this is incorrect. Remember that the graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola, not a straight line!

					To two decimal places, the solutions to the equation are <m>122.54</m> and <m>277.46</m>.

			<li><title>Step 3</title>

					To two decimal places, the solutions to the equation are <m>122.54</m> and <m>277.46</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>The graph of the equation is a parabola that opens downward, because the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is negative. (See <xref ref="fig-quadratic-inequality3" text="type-global"/>.)</p>

			</li>
			<li><p>The graph lies above the <m>x</m>-axis, and hence <m>y \gt 0</m>, for <m>x</m>-values between the two <m>x</m>-intercepts, that is, for <m>122.54 \lt x \lt 277.46</m>. Because we cannot produce a fraction of a parka, we restrict the interval to the closest whole number <m>x</m>-values included, namely <m>123</m> and <m>277</m>. Thus, TrailGear can produce as few as <m>123</m> parkas or as many as <m>277</m> parkas per month to keep its profit above <m>\$  2000</m>.
