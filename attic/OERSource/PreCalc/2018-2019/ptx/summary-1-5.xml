<subsubsection><title>CONCEPTS</title>
<p>
	<ol label="1">
		<li><p>Linear functions form a two-parameter family, <m>f (x) = b + mx</m>.</p></li>
		<li><p>The initial value of a linear function and the <m>y</m>-intercept of its graph are given by <m>b</m>. The rate of change of the function and the slope of its graph are given by <m>m</m>.</p></li>
		<li><p>The slope-intercept form, <m>y = b + mx</m>, is useful when we know the initial value and the rate of change.</p></li>
		<li><p>The point-slope form, <m>y = y_1 + m(x - x_1)</m>, is useful when we know the rate of change and one point on the line.</p></li>
	</ol>

		<li><p>Explain how to find an equation for a line from its graph.</p></li>
		<li><p>Explain how to use the point-slope form for a linear equation.</p></li>
		<li><p>Francine says that the slope of the line <m>y = 4x - 6</m> is <m>4x</m>. Is she correct? Explain your answer</p></li>
		<li><p>Delbert says that the slope of the line <m>3x - 4y = 8</m> is <m>3</m>. Is he correct? Explain your answer.</p></li>
