<title>The Vertex of a Parabola</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	The graph of a quadratic function <m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m> is called a <term>parabola</term><idx>parabola</idx>. Some parabolas are shown in <xref ref="fig-parabola-diagram" text="type-global"/>.</p>
	<figure xml:id="fig-parabola-diagram"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-parabola-diagram"><description>two parabolas with labeled features</description></image></figure>

<p>
	All these parabolas share certain features. The graph has either a highest point (if the parabola opens downward, as in <xref ref="fig-parabola-diagram" text="type-global"/>a) or a lowest point (if the parabola opens upward, as in <xref ref="fig-parabola-diagram" text="type-global"/>b). This high or low point is called the <term>vertex</term><idx>vertex</idx> of the graph.</p> <p>The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line, called the <term>axis of symmetry</term><idx>axis of symmetry</idx>, that runs through the vertex. The <m>y</m>-intercept is the point where the parabola intersects the <m>y</m>-axis. The graph of a quadratic function always has exactly one <m>y</m>-<term>intercept</term><idx>intercept</idx>.</p> <p> However, the graph may cross the <m>x</m>-axis at one point, at two points, or not at all. Points where the parabola intersects the <m>x</m>-axis are called the <m>x</m>-<term>intercepts</term>. If there are two <m>x</m>-intercepts, they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry.
</p>
<p>
	The values of the constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> determine the location and orientation of the parabola. We will begin by considering each of these constants separately.
</p>

<assemblage><title> Vertex Form</title>
    <p>
        When a quadratic function is written in the form
        <me> y=a(x-h)^2+k </me>
        we say that the quadratic is written in <term>vertex form</term>. Once written in this form, the vertex of the parabola is the point <m> (h,k)</m> and the axis of symmetry is the line <m> x=h </m>.
        </p>
    </assemblage>


<warning>
    <p>
        Notice in the definition given above, the vertex of the parabola is <m> (\alert{h},k)</m> and yet in the formula we have <m> -h </m> showing up
        <me> y=a(x\alert{-h})^2+k.</me>
        If, for example we have a parabola written as
        <me> y=2(x+4)^2-3</me>
        then the vertex is <em> not </em> <m>(4,-3)</m>, but rather it is <m> (-4,-3)</m> as we would have to rewrite it as
    <me>2(x+4)^2-3=2(x-(-4))^2-3</me>
    in order to have the parabola written in vertex form.
        </p>

<subsection><title>Finding the Vertex</title>
    <p>
        The process we will use to put a quadratic into vertex form is through a process called <term> completing the square</term>. Given a quadratic function in the form
        <me> f(x)=x^2+bx,</me>
        to <em> complete the square</em> we simply
        <ol>
            <li>
               <p> divide <m> b </m> by <m>2</m> and square the outcome, to get
                <me> (\dfrac{b}{2})^2</me>
                </p>
                </li>
            
            <li>
               <p> then add zero to the function by adding and subtracting this number
                <me> f(x)=x^2+bx=(x^2+bx+(\dfrac{b}{2})^2)-(\dfrac{b}{2})^2 </me>
                    </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  <p>  we have then completed the square in that we may write
                    \begin{align*}
                    f(x)=x^2+bx \amp =\alert{(x^2+bx+(\dfrac{b}{2})^2)}-(\dfrac{b}{2})^2\\
                    \amp = \alert{(x+\dfrac{b}{2})^2}-(\dfrac{b}{2})^2
                    \end{align*}
                    </p>
                    </li>
            </ol>
        
        
        The best way to learn this is through examples, so let's work through one together.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="example-general-quadratic"><statement>
            <p>
                Put the quadratic <m>y=2x^2 - 6x - 5</m> into vertex form.
            </p>
        </statement><solution>
            <p><ol label="1">
                <li>
                    <p>Start by factoring out the coefficient of the term <m> x^2</m>, but do not factor it out of the constant term:
                        <me>2x^2 - 6x - 5=2\cdot(\alert{x^2 - 3x}) -5.</me>
                        Now, rewrite the expression within the parenthesis with the constant on the right side.
                        <me>2\cdot(\alert{x^2 - 3x} ~<fillin characters="6" /> )-5</me></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Complete the square within the parenthesis
                        <me>p = \frac{1}{2}(-3) = \frac{-3}{2} ~~~\text{ and } ~~~ p^2 = \left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}</me>
                        Add and subtract <m>\frac{9}{4}</m>:
                        <me>2\cdot (x^2 - 3x  \alert{+\frac{9}{4}}) \alert{-2\cdot\frac{9}{4}}.</me>
                    Note that I had to subtract <m>2\cdot\frac{9}{4}</m> as the part that we added within the parenthesis was being multiplied by the constant <m> 2 </m> seen on the far left of the equation.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Rewrite as the square of a binomial
                        <me>2\cdot \left(x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 -5-2\cdot\frac{9}{4}.</me>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Simplify to get the function in vertex form
                        <me> y=2\cdot \left(x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 -\frac{19}{2}. </me>
                        </p>

        </solution></example>

<subsection><title>The Graph of <m>y = ax^2 + bx + c</m></title>
<p>
	Consider the function
	<me>y = 2x^2 + 8x + 6.</me> 
	If we put this quadratic into vertex form we get the equation
    <me> y=2\cdot (x+2)^2-2.</me>
    From the vertex form we read off the vertex to be <m> (-2,-2)</m> with axis of symmetry along the line <m> x=-2</m>.
</p>
<p>
    We find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph by setting <m>y</m> equal to zero. For this, it is easier to go back to the function as written in standard form:
	\begin{align*}
	0 \amp= 2x^2 + 8x + 6\amp\amp\text{Factor the right side.}\\
	\amp= 2(x + 1)(x + 3)\amp\amp\text{Set each factor equal to zero.}\\
	x + 1 \amp=0 ~~~\text{ or } ~~~x + 3 = 0\\
	x\amp= -1  \hphantom{blankbl} x = -3
	\end{align*}
	The <m>x</m>-intercepts are the points <m>(-1, 0)</m> and <m>(-3, 0)</m>.
</p>
<sidebyside widths="50% 35%"> <p>
	The <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph is found by setting <m>x</m> equal to zero:
	<me>y = 2(\alert{0})2 + 8(\alert{0}) + 6 = 6</me>
	You can see that the <m> y</m>-coordinate of the <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>(0,6)</m>, is just the constant term of the quadratic equation. The completed graph is shown in <xref ref="fig-scaled-and-shifted-parabola" text="type-global"/>.

<example xml:id="example-parabola-vertex2"><statement>
	<p>
		Find the vertex of the graph of <m>y = -2x^2 + x + 1</m>.
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		For this equation, <m>a = -2</m>, <m>b = 1</m>, and <m>c = 1</m>. The <m>x</m>-coordinate of the vertex is given by
		<me>x_v =\frac{-b}{2a}=\frac{-1}{2(-2)}=\frac{1}{4}.</me>
		To find the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute <m>x = \alert{\frac{1}{4}}</m> into the equation. We can do this by hand to find
		\begin{align*}
		y_v\amp= -2\left(\alert{\frac{1}{4}}\right)^2+ \alert{\frac{1}{4}}+1\\
		\amp= -2\left(\frac{1}{16}\right)+ \frac{4}{16}+\frac{16}{16}=\frac{18}{16}
		=\frac{9}{8}.
		\end{align*}
		So the coordinates of the vertex are <m>\left(\dfrac{1}{4},\dfrac{9}{8}\right)</m>. Alternatively, we can use the calculator to evaluate <m>-2x^2 + x + 1</m> for <m>x = 0.25</m>. The calculator returns the <m>y</m>-value <m>1.125</m>. Thus, the vertex is the point <m>(0.25, 1.125)</m>, which is the decimal equivalent of <m>\left(\dfrac{1}{4},\dfrac{9}{8}\right)</m>.

<subsection><title>Sketching a Parabola</title>
<p>
	Once we have located the vertex of the parabola, the <m>x</m>-intercepts, and the <m>y</m>-intercept, we can sketch a reasonably accurate graph. Recall that the graph should be symmetric about a vertical line through the vertex. We summarize the procedure as follows.
</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-graph-general-quadratic.xml" />

<example><statement>
	<p>
		Sketch a graph of the equation <m>y = x^2 + 3x + 1</m>, showing the significant points.
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		We follow the steps outlined above.
		<ol label="1">
			<li>
				<p>Because <m>a = 1 \gt 0</m>, we know that the parabola opens upward.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Compute the coordinates of the vertex:
				<me>\begin{aligned}
					x_v\amp=\frac{-b}{2a}=\frac{-3}{2(1)}= -1.5\\
					y_v\amp=  (-1.5)2 + 3(-1.5) + 1 = -1.25
					\end{aligned}
				</me>
				The vertex is the point <m>(-1.5,-1.25)</m>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Set <m>y</m> equal to zero to find the <m>x</m>-intercepts.
				<me>\begin{aligned}
					0 \amp= x^2 + 3x + 1\amp\amp\text{Use the quadratic formula.}\\
					x \amp=\frac{-3\pm\sqrt{3^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}\\
					\amp=\frac{-3\pm\sqrt{5}}{2}
					\end{aligned}
				</me>
				Rounding to the nearest tenth, we find that the <m>x</m>-intercepts are approximately <m>(-2.6, 0)</m> and <m>(-0.4, 0)</m>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Substitute <m>x = 0</m> to find the <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>(0, 1)</m>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The axis of symmetry is the vertical line <m>x = -1.5</m>, so the <m>y</m>-intercept lies <m>1.5</m> units to the right of the axis of symmetry. </p>
				<p> There must be another point on the parabola with the same <m>y</m>-coordinate as the <m>y</m>-intercept but <m>1.5</m> units to the left of the axis of symmetry. The coordinates of this point are <m>(-3, 1)</m>.
				</p>
				<p>Finally, plot the <m>x</m>-intercepts, the vertex, and the <m>y</m>-intercept and its symmetric point, and draw a parabola through them. The finished graph is shown in <xref ref="fig-parabola-with-5-labeled-points" text="type-global"/>.</p>
