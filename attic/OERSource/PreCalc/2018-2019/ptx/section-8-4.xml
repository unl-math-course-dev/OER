<title>Linear Inequalities</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	In this section, we study linear inequalities in two variables and how they arise in applications.
</p>
</introduction>
<subsection><title>Graphs of Inequalities in Two Variables</title>
<p>
	Ivana is investing in the hotel business. She has bought two hotels, and she will expand her investments when her total profit from the two hotels exceeds <m>\$10,000</m>. If we let <m>x</m> represent the profit from one hotel and let <m>y</m> represent the profit from the other, then Ivana will expand her investments when
	<me>
		x + y \ge 10,000
	</me>
	Notice that the equation <m>x + y = 10,000</m> is not appropriate to model our situation, since Ivana will be delighted if her profits are not exactly equal to <m>\$10,000</m> but actually exceed that amount.
</p>
<p>
	A <term>solution</term><idx>solution</idx> to an inequality in two variables is an ordered pair of numbers that satisfies the inequality. The graph of the inequality must show all the points whose coordinates are solutions. As an example, let us graph the inequality above, <m>x + y \ge 10,000</m>.
</p>
<p>
	Rewrite the inequality by subtracting <m>x</m> from both sides to get
	<me>
		y \ge -x + 10,000
	</me>
	This inequality says that for each <m>x</m>-value, we must choose points with <m>y</m>-values greater than or equal to <m>-x + 10,000</m>. For example, when <m>x = 2000</m>, we must choose points with <m>y</m>-values greater than or equal to <m>8000</m>. Solutions for several choices of <m>x</m> are shown in <xref ref="fig-linear-inequality" text="type-global"/>a.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-linear-inequality"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-linear-inequality"  width="80%"><description>linear inequality in two variables</description></image> </figure>
<p>
	A more efficient way to find all the solutions of the inequality is to start with the graph of the corresponding equation
	<me>
		y = -x + 10,000
	</me>
	The graph is a straight line, as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-linear-inequality" text="type-global"/>b. Observe that any point above this line has a y-coordinate greater than <m>-x + 10,000</m> and hence satisfies the inequality. Thus, the graph of the inequality includes all the points on or above the line <m>y = -x + 10,000</m>, as shown by the shaded region in <xref ref="fig-linear-inequality" text="type-global"/>b.
</p>
<p>
	You can check that the shaded points are also solutions to the original inequality, <m>x + y \ge 10,000</m>. Consider the point <m>(-1000, 12,000)</m>, which lies in the shaded region above the line. This pair does satisfy <m>x + y \ge 10,000</m>, because
	<me>
		-1000 + 12,000 \ge 10,000
	</me>
	(Ivana will expand her investments if her first hotel loses <m>\$1000</m> and her second has a profit of <m>\$12,000</m>.) On the other hand, the point <m>(5000, 4000)</m> does not lie in the graph of <m>x + y \ge 10,000</m>, because the coordinates do not satisfy the inequality.
</p>

</subsection>



<subsection><title>Linear Inequalities</title>
<p>
	A <term>linear inequality</term><idx>linear inequality</idx> can be written in the form
	<me>
		ax + by + c \le 0 ~~~\text{ or }~~~  ax + by + c \ge 0
	</me>
	The solutions consist of the line <m>ax + by + c = 0</m> and a <term>half-plane</term><idx>half-plane</idx> on one side of that line. We shade the half-plane to show that all its points are included in the solution set. If the inequality is strict, then the graph includes only the half-plane and not the line. In that case, we use a dashed line for the graph of the equation <m>ax + by + c = 0</m> to show that it is not part of the solution.
</p>
<p>
	To decide which side of the line to shade, we can solve the inequality for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>. If we obtain
	<me>
		y \ge mx + b ~~~(\text{or }~~~y \gt mx + b)
	</me>
	then we shade the half-plane <em>above</em> the line. If the inequality is equivalent to
	<me>
		y \le mx + b ~~~(\text{or }~~~y \lt mx + b)		
	</me>
	then we shade the half-plane <em>below</em> the line.
</p>

<warning>
	<p>
		Be careful when isolating <m>y</m>: We must remember to reverse the direction of the inequality whenever we multiply or divide by a negative number. (See Algebra Skills Refresher <xref ref="appendix-Linear-Equations-and-Inequalities" text="global"/> if you would like to review solving inequalities.)

		Note that the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>-4</m> and the slope is <m>\frac{4}{3}</m>. (See <xref ref="linear-functions" text="type-global"/> to review the slope-intercept method of graphing.) Finally, we shade the half-plane below the line. The completed graph is shown in <xref ref="fig-linear-inequality2" text="type-global"/>.</p>

<subsection><title>Using a Test Point</title>
<p>
	A second method for graphing inequalities does not require us to solve for <m>y</m>. Once we have graphed the boundary line, we can decide which half-plane to shade by using a test point. The test point can be any point that is not on the boundary line itself.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-linear-inequality-test-point"><statement>
	<p>
		Graph the solutions of the inequality <m>3x - 2y\lt 6</m>.
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		First, we graph the line <m>3x - 2y = 6</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-linear-inequality3" text="type-global"/>. We will use the intercept method. The intercepts are <m>(2, 0)</m> and <m>(0, -3)</m>, so we sketch the boundary line through those points. </p>
		<p> Next, we choose a test point. Because <m>(0, 0)</m> does not lie on the line, we choose it as our test point. We substitute the coordinates of the test point into the inequality to obtain 
		<me>
			3(\alert{0}) - 2(\alert{0}) \lt 6
		</me>
		Because this is a true statement, <m>(0, 0)</m> is a solution of the inequality. Since all the solutions lie on the same side of the boundary line, we shade the half-plane that contains the test point. In this example, the boundary line is a dashed line because the original inequality was strict.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-linear-inequality3"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-linear-inequality3"  width="40%"><description>strict linear inequality in two variables</description></image> </figure>

</solution></example>

<p>
	We can choose <em>any</em> point for the test point as long as it does not lie on the boundary line. We chose <m>(0, 0)</m> in Example 2 because the coordinates are easy to substitute into the inequality. If the test point <em>is</em> a solution to the inequality, then the half-plane including that point should be shaded. If the test point is <em>not</em> a solution to the inequality, then the <em>other</em> half-plane should be shaded.</p>
	<p> For example, suppose we had chosen (5, 0) as the test point in <xref ref="example-linear-inequality-test-point" text="type-global"/>. When we substitute its coordinates into the inequality, we find
	<me>
		3(\alert{5}) - 2(\blert{0}) \lt 6
	</me>
	which is a <em>false</em> statement. This tells us that <m>(5, 0)</m> is not a solution to the inequality, so the solutions must lie on the other side of the boundary line. Using (5, 0) as the test point gives us the same solutions we found in <xref ref="example-linear-inequality-test-point" text="type-global"/>.
</p>
<p>
	Here is a summary of our test point method for graphing inequalities.
</p>

			</p></li>

</exercise>

<p>
	Recall that the equation of a vertical line has the form
	<me>x=k</me>
	where <m>k</m> is a constant, and a horizontal line has an equation of the form
	<me>y=k</me>
	Similarly, the inequality <m>x\ge k</m> may represent the inequality in two variables
	<me>x+0y\ge k</me>
	Its graph is then a region in the plane.
</p>

<example><statement>
	<p>
		Graph <m>x\ge 2</m> in the plane.
	</p>
</statement><solution>
	<p>
		First, we graph the equation <m>x = 2</m>; its graph is a vertical line. Since the origin does not lie on this line, we can use it as a test point. Substitute <m>0</m> for <m>x</m> (there is no <m>y</m>) into the inequality to obtain
		<me>0\ge 2</me>
		Since this is a false statement, shade the half-plane that does not contain the origin. We see in <xref ref="fig-planar-graph-x-greater-or-equal-2" text="type-global"/> that the graph of the inequality contains all points whose <m>x</m>-coordinates are greater than or equal to <m>2</m>.</p>

<p>
	Some applications are best described by a system of two or more inequalities. The solutions to a system of inequalities include all points that are solutions to each inequality in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system. For example, <xref ref="fig-system-of-inequalities" text="type-global"/> shows the solutions of the system
	<me>
		y \gt x ~~~\text{ and }~~~ y \gt 2

Her morning cereal satisfies some of her calcium requirements, but she needs an additional 500 milligrams of calcium, which she will get from a combination of broccoli, at 160 milligrams per serving, and zucchini, at 30 milligrams per serving. Draw a graph representing the possible combinations of broccoli and zucchini that fulfill Laura's calcium requirements.
