<subsubsection><title>CONCEPTS</title>
<p>
	<ol label="1">
		<li><p>The solutions of a linear inequality in two variables consist of a <term>half-plane</term> on one side of the line. The line itself is not included if the inequality is strict.</p></li>
		<li><p>Once we have graphed the boundary line, we can decide which half-plane to shade by using a <term>test point</term>.</p></li>
		<li><xi:include href="./assemblage-graph-inequality-using-test-point.xml" /></li>
		<li><p>The solutions to a system of inequalities include all points that are solutions to each inequality in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system.</p></li>
		<li><p>To describe the solutions of a system of inequalities, it is useful to locate the <term>vertices</term>, or corner points, of the boundary.</p></li>
    </ol>

<subsubsection><title>STUDY QUESTIONS</title><p>
	<ol label="1">
		<li><p>The solutions of a linear inequality in two variables form what sort of set?</p></li>
		<li><p>How can you find the boundary of the solution set?</p></li>
		<li><p>If your test point is not a solution of the inequality, which side of the line should you shade?</p></li>
		<li><p>How can you find the vertices of the solution set of a system of inequalities?</p></li>
