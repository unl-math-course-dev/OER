    <title>Steps for Solving a <m>3\times 3</m> Linear System</title>
    <p>
		<ol label="1">
			<li><p>
				Clear each equation of fractions and put it in standard form.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Choose two of the equations and eliminate one of the variables by forming a linear combination.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Choose a different pair of equations and eliminate the <em>same</em> variable.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Form a <m>2\times 2</m> system with the equations found in steps (2) and (3). Eliminate one of the variables from this <m>2\times 2</m> system by using a linear combination.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Form a triangular system by choosing among the previous equations. Use back-substitution to solve the triangular system.
