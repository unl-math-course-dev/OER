<title>The Absolute Value Function</title><introduction>
<p>
    The absolute value function is used to model problems involving distance. Recall that the absolute value of a number gives the distance from the origin to that number on the number line.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Distance and Absolute Value</title>
<p>The distance between two points <m>x</m> and <m>a</m> is given by <m>\abs{x - a}</m>.</p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    For example, the equation <m>\abs{x - 2} = 6</m> means "the distance between <m>x</m> and <m>2</m> is <m>6</m> units." The number <m>x</m> could be to the left or the right of <m>2</m> on the number line. Thus, the equation has two solutions, <m>8</m> and <m>-4</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-abs-x-minus-2-is-6" text="type-global"/>.

<subsection><title>Absolute Value Equations</title>

<p>
    We can use distances on a number line to solve simple equations such as
    <me>\abs{3x - 6} = 9</me>
    First, we factor out the coefficient of <m>x</m>, to get <m>\abs{3(x - 2)} = 9</m>. Because of the multiplicative property of the absolute value, namely that 
    <m>\abs{ab} = \abs{a}\abs{b}</m>, we can write the left side as 
    \begin{align*}
    \abs{3}\abs{x - 2} \amp = 9 \\
    3\abs{x - 2} \amp= 9 \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by 3.}\\
     \abs{x - 2} \amp = 3 
     \end{align*}
     which tells us that the distance between <m>x</m> and <m>2</m> is <m>3</m> units, so the solutions are <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 5</m>. 
</p>

<sidebyside widths= "50% 40%">
<paragraphs><p>Alternatively, we can use graphs when working with absolute values. For example, we know that the simple equation <m>\abs{x} = 5</m> has two solutions, <m>x = 5</m> and <m>x = -5</m>.</p><p> In fact, we can see from the graph in <xref ref="fig-abs-x-is-k" text="type-global"/> that the equation <m>\abs{x} = k</m> has two solutions if <m>k \gt 0</m>, one solution if <m>k = 0</m>, and no solution if <m>k \lt 0</m>.</p></paragraphs>

<exercise xml:id="exercise-GC-solve-abs-equation"><statement>

    </ol>
</statement></exercise>
<p>
    To solve an absolute value equation algebraically, we use the definition of absolute value.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-abs-algebraic"><statement>
    <p>
        Solve the equation <m>\abs{3x - 6} = 9</m> algebraically.
    </p>
</statement><solution><p>
    We write the piecewise definition of <m>\abs{3x - 6}</m>.
    <me>
    \abs{3x-6} =
    \begin{cases}
    3x-6 \amp \text{if } 3x-6\ge 0 \text{, or  } x\ge 2\\
    -(3x-6)  \amp \text{if } 3x - 6\lt 0  \text{, or  }x\lt 2
    \end{cases}
    </me>
    Thus, the absolute value equation <m>\abs{3x - 6} = 9</m> is equivalent to two regular equations:
    <me>3x - 6 =9  \text{ or } -(3x - 6) = 9</me>
    or, by simplifying the second equation,
    <me>3x - 6 =9 \text{ or } 3x - 6 = -9</me>
    Solving these two equations gives us the same solutions we found in <xref ref="example-abs-equation" text="type-global"/>, <m>x = 5</m> and <m>-1</m>.
</p></solution>
</example>

<p>
    In general, we have the following strategy for solving absolute value equations.

    The equation
    <me>\abs{ax + b} = c \hphantom{break} (c \gt 0)</me>

    Solve <m>\abs{2x + 7} = 11</m> algebraically.
</p></statement></exercise>

</subsection>


<subsection><title>Absolute Value Inequalities</title>
<p>
    We can also use graphs to solve absolute value inequalities. Look again at the graph of <m>y = \abs{3x - 6}</m> in <xref ref="fig-abs-inequality" text="type-global"/>a. Because of the V-shape of the graph, all points with <m>y</m>-values less than <m>9</m> lie between the two solutions of <m>\abs{3x - 6} = 9</m>, that is, between <m>-1</m> and <m>5</m>. Thus, the solutions of the inequality <m>\abs{3x - 6} \lt 9</m> are <m>-1 \lt x \lt 5</m>. (In the Homework problems, you will be asked to show this algebraically.) 
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, to solve the inequality <m>\abs{3x - 6} \gt 9</m>, we look for points on the graph with <m>y</m>-values greater than <m>9</m>. In <xref ref="fig-abs-inequality" text="type-global"/>b, we see that these points have <m>x</m>-values outside the interval between <m>-1</m> and <m>5</m>. In other words, the solutions of the inequality <m>\abs{3x - 6} \gt 9</m> are <m>x \lt -1</m> or <m>x \gt 5</m>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-abs-inequality"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-abs-inequality"  width="75%"><description>abs-3x-6</description></image></figure>
<p>
    Thus, we can solve an absolute value inequality by first solving the related equation.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Absolute Value Inequalities</title>
<p>
    Suppose the solutions of the equation <m>\abs{ax+b}=c</m> are <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>, with <m>r \lt s</m>. Then
    <ol>
        <li>The solutions of <m>\abs{ax+b} \lt c</m> are 
        <me>r \lt  x \lt  s</me></li>
        <li>The solutions of <m>\abs{ax+b} \gt c</m> are
        <me>x \lt  r ~~\text{ or }~~ x \gt  s</me></li>
    </ol>
</p>
</assemblage>

<example xml:id="example-abs-inequality"><statement>
<p>
    Solve <m>\abs{4x - 15} \lt 0.01</m>.
</p>
</statement><solution>
    <p>First, we solve the equation <m>\abs{4x - 15} = 0.01</m>. There are two cases:
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        4x - 15 \amp = 0.01 \amp \text{or} \amp\amp 4x - 15 \amp= -0.01 \\
        4x \amp = 15.01 \amp\amp\amp 4x \amp = 14.99 \\
        x \amp = 3.7525 \amp\amp\amp x \amp= 3.7475
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
        Because the inequality symbol is <m>\lt</m>, the solutions of the inequality are between these two values: <m>3.7475 \lt x \lt 3.7525</m>. In interval notation, the solutions are <m>(3.7475, 3.7525)</m>.
    </p>

<subsection><title>Using the Absolute Value in Modeling</title>
<p>
    In Example 5, we use the absolute value function to model a problem about distances.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-Marlene-highway"><statement>
    <p>
        Marlene is driving to a new outlet mall on Highway 17. There is a gas station at Marlene's on-ramp, where she buys gas and resets her odometer to zero before getting on the highway. The mall is only 15 miles from Marlene's on-ramp, but she mistakenly drives past the mall and continues down the highway. Marlene's distance from the mall is a function of how far she has driven on Highway 17. See <xref ref="fig-Marlene-highway" text="type-global"/>.

        Let <m>x</m> represent the number of miles on the highway and <m>f (x)</m> the number of miles from the mall. For <m>x</m>-values less than <m>15</m>, the graph is a straight line with slope <m>-1</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept at <m>(0, 15)</m>, so its equation is <m>y = -x + 15</m>. Thus,
        <me>f (x) = -x + 15 \text{ when } 0 \le x \lt 15</me>
        On the other hand, when <m>x \ge 15</m>, the graph of <m>f</m> is a straight line with slope <m>1</m> that passes through the point <m>(15, 0)</m>. The point-slope form of this line is
        <me>y = 0 + 1(x - 15)</me>
        so <m>y = x - 15</m>. Thus,
        <me>f (x) = x - 15 \text{ when }  x \ge 15</me>
        Combining the two pieces, we obtain
        <me>
        f (x) =

        -x + 15 \amp \text{when } 0\le x\lt 15\\

        The graph of <m>f (x)</m> is a part of the graph of <m>y = \abs{x - 15}</m>. If we think of the highway as a portion of the real number line, with Marlene's on-ramp located at the origin, then the outlet mall is located at <m>15</m>. Marlene's coordinate as she drives along the highway is <m>x</m>, and the distance from Marlene to the mall is given by <m>f (x) = \abs{x - 15}</m>.

<subsection><title>Measurement Error</title>
<p>
    If you weigh a sample in chemistry lab, the scale's digital readout might show <m>6.0</m> grams. But it is unlikely that the sample weighs <em>exactly</em> <m>6</m> grams; there is always some error in measured values.</p>
    <p> Because the scale shows the weight as <m>6.0</m> grams, we know that the true weight of the sample must be between <m>5.95</m> grams and <m>6.05</m> grams: If the weight were less than <m>5.95</m> grams, the scale would round down to <m>5.9</m> grams, and if the weight were more than <m>6.05</m> grams, the scale would round up to <m>6.1</m> grams. We should report the mass of the sample as <m>6 \pm 0.05</m> grams, which tells the reader that the error in the measurement is no more than <m>0.05</m> grams. 
</p>
<p>
    We can also describe this measurement error, or <term>error tolerance</term><idx>error tolerance</idx>, using an absolute value inequality. Because the measured mass m can be no more than <m>0.05</m> from <m>6</m>, we write 
    <me>\abs{m - 6} \le 0.05</me> 
    Note that the solution of this inequality is <m>5.95 \le m \le 6.05</m>.
