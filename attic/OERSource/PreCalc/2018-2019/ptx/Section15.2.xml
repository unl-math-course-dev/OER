	In <xref ref='polar-coordinates'/> we used the radius of a circle, <m>r</m>, and an angle, <m>\theta</m> to define polar coordinates. In this section, we use these variables to find the length of arcs on circles. </p>

        An <term>arc</term><idx>arc</idx> is a portion of the circumference of a circle. </p>
    <p>
        <term>Arc length</term><idx>Arc length</idx> is defined as the length of an arc, <m>s</m>, along a circle of radius <m>r</m> subtended (drawn out) by an angle <m>\theta</m>. </p>

		The length of the arc around an entire circle is called the <term>circumference</term><idx>circumference</idx> of the circle. The circumference of a circle is

<p>
    To find the length of an arc along a circle of radius <m>r</m>, we can think of the arc as a portion of the circumference of the circle. Consider the following example. </p>

<example>
    <statement>
    <p>
        Find the length of an arc on a circle of radius 2 subtended by an angle of 45 degrees. </p></statement>
    <solution>
    <p>
    	Let's start by drawing a picture of the arc and labeling the known information.
    	</p>
    <p>
    	We want to find the arc length, <m>s</m>, of an arc corresponding to an angle of 45 degrees on a circle of radius 2. </p>

    <p>
    	To find the arc length, we can think about the arc as a portion of the circle's circumference. The circumference of the circle is </p>
    	<me>C = 2\pi r = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi</me>
    <p>
    	Since the arc corresponding to <m>45^\circ</m> is one-eighth of the full circumference of the circle, the arc length is </p>
    	<me>s = 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{2}</me>
        </solution>
</example>

<p>
	Recall from <xref ref='unit-circle'/> that we defined radians as an angle measurement that arises by looking at angles as a fraction of the unit circle. Since the radius of the unit circle is 1, the circumference of the unit circle is <m>2\pi</m>. This is why there are <m>2\pi</m> radians in one complete trip around a circle. Thus, arc lengths on the unit circle correspond to the angle measures (in radians) that those arcs subtend. </p>

<p>
	For example, consider an arc subtended by an angle of <m>\pi/2</m> radians on the unit circle. Since the circumference of the unit circle is <m>2\pi</m> and the arc is one-fourth of the circumference, the arc length is
	<me>2\pi \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}</me>
	This corresponds exactly to the angle subtended by the arc, <m>\pi/2</m>. </p>
