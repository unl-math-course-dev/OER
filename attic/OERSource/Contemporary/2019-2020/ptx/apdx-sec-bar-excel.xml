<title>How to make a bar graph in Microsoft Excel</title>

		<p>This tutorial uses the following data set. It contains the scores on a 5 point quiz for a class of 18 students.</p>

		<table xml:id="tutorial-table1"><caption>Number of students who earned each score</caption>
			<tabular top="minor" bottom="minor" left="minor" right="minor">
				<row>
					<cell>Score</cell>
					<cell>5</cell>
					<cell>4</cell>
					<cell>3</cell>
					<cell>2</cell>
					<cell>1</cell>
					<cell>0</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>Count</cell>
					<cell>6</cell>
					<cell>2</cell>
					<cell>3</cell>
					<cell>0</cell>
					<cell>2</cell>
					<cell>5</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</table>

		<p><dl>
			<li><title>Part 1: Enter the data</title>
			<p><ol>
				<li>Write headings VALUE, COUNT, PERCENT in A1, B1, C1.</li>
				<li><p>Enter the values, taking advantage of the fact that the values all differ by the same amount.
					<ol>
						<li>Write the score 0 in A2.</li>
						<li>Write =A2+1 in A3.</li>
						<li>Click the lower-right corner of cell A3 and down to enter scores 2 through 5 in A4 through A7.</li>
					</ol></p></li>
				<li>Write SUM in A9.</li>
				<li>Enter the counts in B2 through B7.</li>
				<li>Sum up the counts by writing “=sum(B2:B7)” (without the quotation marks) in B9.</li>
			</ol>
			</p></li>

			<li><title>Part 2: Make a bar graph of counts</title>
			<p><ol>
				<li>Highlight the values and counts (A2 through B7).</li>
				<li>Click Insert and click the icon for Recommended Charts.</li>
				<li>You should see one labeled Clustered Column and showing one set of columns with the correct labels and data values.  Click OK.</li>
				<li>Change the generic title to a meaningful one.</li>
			</ol></p></li>

			<li><title>Part 3: Add data for percentages</title>
			<p><ol>
				<li>Compute the percentage for the first value by writing “=100*B2/B9” (without the quotation marks) in C2.</li>
				<li><p>We need to apply the same formula several times. Here is a way to make that easier.
					<ol>
						<li>Attempt to repeat the formula for the other values by dragging C2 down to C7.</li>
						<li>To see what went wrong, look at the formula that appeared in C3.  What should the correct formula be?</li>
						<li>Compute the correct percentages by changing the formula in C2 to “=100*B2/B$9” and repeating part (b).</li>
						<li>What does the $ do?</li>
					</ol></p></li>
				<li>Make column C easier to read by highlighting the whole column and clicking Format, Format Cells, Number from the Cells menu.</li>
			</ol></p></li>

			<li><title>Part 4: Make a bar graph of percentages</title>
			<p><ol>
				<li>
					<p>Transfer the value and percentage data to new adjacent columns.
					<ol>
						<li>Highlight A1 through A7.  Click Ctrl-C.  Put the cursor in E1 and click Ctrl-V.</li>
						<li>Highlight C1 through C7.  Click Ctrl-C.  Put the cursor in F1.</li>
						<li>Click Paste at the far left of the menu bar.  Under Paste Values, chose Values and Number Formatting.</li>
					</ol></p></li>
				<li>Make the bar graph by repeating part 2 using columns E and F instead of A and B.</li>
			</ol></p></li>
