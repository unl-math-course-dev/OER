		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <term>Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) criterion</term> states that election results should not change if a losing candidate is left out.</li>
				<li>To check whether IIA is violated, we must remove a losing candidate, keeping the voters' preferences the same otherwise, and then find the winner of the new election. If the winner of the new election is different than the old election, then IIA was violated.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<p>
		Let's use this example to show how all of our voting methods violate IIA.

	<assemblage><title>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</title>
		<p>
			Any voting method that uses voters' ranked choices to decide an election with a single winner will violate at least one of the four criteria we've discussed: majority, monotonicity, Condorcet, or IIA.

		The map in <xref ref="electoral-systems-map"/> shows the systems used to elect the lower house of each country's legislature. You can see a larger version if you right-click and select <q>view image</q>. Note that the Borda count is included in the <q>other systems</q> category (green), but is used in only one of those countries: the Pacific island nation of Nauru. It is also used, however, to elect two seats in the parliament of Slovenia that are reserved for the Hungarian and Italian ethnic minorities.
