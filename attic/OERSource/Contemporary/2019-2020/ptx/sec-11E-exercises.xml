		<p>1. To deliver mail in a particular neighborhood, the postal carrier needs to walk along each of the streets with houses (the dots). See
			Graph A of <xref ref="create-graphs"/>.  Create a graph with edges showing where the carrier must walk to deliver the mail.

				<p>2. Suppose that a town has 7 bridges as pictured in Graph B of <xref ref="create-graphs"/>. Create a graph that could be used to determine if there is a path that crosses all bridges once. </p>

					3. The table in <xref ref="Dallas-area-drive-times"/> below shows approximate driving times (in minutes, without traffic) between five cities in the Dallas area. Create a weighted graph representing this data. </p>

				 4. Identify the bridges (if any) in each of the graphs in <xref ref="Check-bridges"/>. </p>

				5. Draw a graph to fit each of the descriptions below.  Label each vertex. Then for each graph, provide the following information:  (i) next to each vertex, write its degree; (ii) give the total number of edges; (iii) give the total number of components.
				<p><ul>
						<li>   a. It has at least 7 vertices and exactly one bridge. </li>
						<li>   b. It has at least six edges and at least two components.</li>
						<li>   c. It has exactly four vertices each of degree 3.</li>
						<li>   d. It is connected and has five vertices, exactly one of which has degree 1. Does your graph have any bridges?</li>
						<li>   e. It is connected and has five vertices, all of which have degree 2. Does this graph have any bridges?</li>
				</ul></p>

6. For each of the graphs in <xref ref="Check-Euler-circuits-or-paths"/> below, if one exists, find an Euler circuit or an Euler path.  If an Euler circuit or path do not exists, explain why.

	7. After a storm, the city crew inspects for trees or brush blocking the road. For the two neighborhoods shown in <xref ref="Street-crew-eulerize-graphs"/> below, find an efficient route for the crew by finding an Euler circuit. If necessary, Eulerize the graph in an efficient way.

	<p>
		8. For the graphs in <xref ref="Euler-graphs-theorems-check"/>, do each of the following: (i) identify whether the graph has an Euler
circuit, an Euler path, or neither and explain why using theorems from this chapter; (ii) if the graph does have either an Euler path or circuit, find one; (iii) if the graph does not have an Euler path or circuit, Eulerize it so that it has an Euler circuit.
