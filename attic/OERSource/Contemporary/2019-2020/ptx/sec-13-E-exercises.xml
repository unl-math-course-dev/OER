		<li> Which of the graphs in <xref ref="network-graphs"/> above are trees? Explain how you know. </li>

		<li><p>
			Given the descriptions below, decide which of these options applies and explain your choice: (T) the graph is definitely a tree, (N) the graph is definitely not a tree, (M) the graph may or may not be a tree (more information is needed).
			<ol>
					<li> A network has 12 vertices and 13 edges. </li>
					<li> A network has 12 vertices and 12 edges. </li>
					<li> A network has 12 vertices and 12 bridges. </li>
					<li> A network has 12 vertices and 11 edges. </li>
					<li> A network has 12 vertices and at least 11 edges. </li>
					<li> A network has 12 vertices and 11 bridges. </li>
					<li> A network has 7 vertices (A through G) and there is only one path connecting A and G. </li>
					<li> A network has 7 vertices, all of which have degree 2. </li>

			<li> The table below gives the distance (in kilometers) between several cities in Nebraska.  Use Kruskal's algorithm to find a minimal spanning tree for these cities. Draw the tree and give its total weight. </li>
