    <p>This is an example of a subsection with a little mathematics involved.</p>

<p>A <term>prime number</term> is an integer greater than <m>1</m> that is divisible only by <m>1</m> and itself. The smallest prime number is <m>2</m> and the rest are necessarily odd:</p>

<me>2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,\dots</me>

<p>Any integer greater than <m>1</m> that is not prime can be uniquely written as a product of primes. When such a number, like <m>42</m>, is written as a product, <m>42=2\cdot 21</m>, we say that <m>2\cdot 21</m> is a factorization of <m>42</m> and that <m>2</m> and <m>21</m> are <term>factors</term>. Note that factors divide the number evenly. We can continue to write factors as products until only a product of primes remains.</p>


<p>Therefore the prime factorization of <m>42</m> is <m>2\cdot 3\cdot 7</m>.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Determine the prime factorization of <m>210</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        We begin by writing <m>210</m> as a product with <m>10</m> as a factor. Then we continue factoring until only a product of primes remains.
        <me>\begin{aligned}
            210\amp =10\cdot 21\\
            \amp =2\cdot 5\cdot 3\cdot 7
            \end{aligned}</me>
        Since the prime factorization is unique, it does not matter how we choose to initially factor the number - the end result will be the same (although you may write your answer in a different order).
