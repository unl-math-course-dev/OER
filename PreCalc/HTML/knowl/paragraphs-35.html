<dl class="description-list">
<dt>absolute value</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the distance on the number line from a number to \(0\text{.}\) For example, the absolute value of \(-7\) is \(7\text{.}\) This fact is expressed by the equation \(\abs{-7} = 7\text{.}\)</p></dd>
<dt>absolute value equation</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an equation in which the variable occurs between the absolute value bars.</p></dd>
<dt>absolute value inequality</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an inequality in which the variable occurs between the absolute value bars.</p></dd>
<dt>algebraic expression</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a meaningful combination of numbers, variables, and operation symbols. Also called an <dfn class="terminology">expression</dfn>.</p></dd>
<dt>algebraic fraction</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a fraction whose numerator and denominator are polynomials. Also called a <dfn class="terminology">rational expression</dfn>.</p></dd>
<dt>algebraic solution</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a method for solving equations (or inequalities) by manipulating the equations (or inequalities). Compare with <dfn class="terminology">graphical solution</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">numerical solution</dfn>.</p></dd>
<dt>allometric equation</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an equation showing the (approximate) relationship between a living organism's body mass and another of the organism's properties or processes, usually given in the form \(y = k (\text{mass})^p\text{.}\)</p></dd>
<dt>altitude</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, (i) the distance above the ground or above sea level; (ii) the vertical distance between the base and the opposite vertex of a triangle, pyramid, or cone; (iii) the distance between parallel sides of a parallelogram, trapezoid, or rectangle. Also called <dfn class="terminology">height</dfn>.</p></dd>
<dt>amortization</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the payment of a debt through regular installments over a period of time.</p></dd>
<dt>amount</dt>
<dd><p>(in an interest-bearing account), <dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the sum of the principal that was invested and all the interest earned.</p></dd>
<dt>amplitude</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the vertical distance between the midline and the maximum value of a sinusoidal function.</p></dd>
<dt>annuity</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, sequence of equal payments or deposits made at equal time intervals.</p></dd>
<dt>approximation</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an inexact result.</p></dd>
<dt>area</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a measure of the two-dimensional space enclosed by a polygon or curve, typically expressed in terms of square units, such as square meters or square feet, etc.</p></dd>
<dt>ascending powers</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, an ordering of the terms of a polynomial so that the exponents on the variable are increasing, such as in the polynomial \(1 + x + x^2\text{.}\)</p></dd>
<dt>associative law of addition</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the property that when adding three or more terms, the grouping of terms does not affect the sum. We express this formally by saying that if \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) are any numbers, then \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\text{.}\)</p></dd>
<dt>associative law of multiplication</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the property that when multiplying three or more factors, the grouping of factors does not affect the product. We express this formally by saying that if \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) are any numbers, then \((a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)\text{.}\)</p></dd>
<dt>asymptote</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a reference line (or curve) towards which the graph of an equation tends as the value of x and/or y grows or diminishes without bound.</p></dd>
<dt>augmented matrix (for a linear systterm with \(n\) variables in standard form),</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, the matrix obtained by making each row of the matrix correspond to an equation of the systterm, with the coefficients of the variables filling the first \(n\) columns, and the last (that is, the \(n + 1\)) column having the constants.</p></dd>
<dt>axis</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, (<dfn class="terminology">plural</dfn> <dfn class="terminology">axes</dfn>), a line used as a reference for position and/or orientation.</p></dd>
<dt>axis of symmetry</dt>
<dd><p><dfn class="terminology">n</dfn>, a line that cuts a plane figure into two parts, each a mirror image of the other.</p></dd>
