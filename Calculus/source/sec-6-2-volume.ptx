      Just as we can use definite integrals to add the areas of rectangular slices to find the exact area that lies between two curves, we can also use integrals to find the volume of regions whose cross-sections have a particular shape.
    </p>

    <p permid="iqM">
      In particular, we can determine the volume of solids whose cross-sections are all thin cylinders (or washers) by adding up the volumes of these individual slices, in particular when these shapes arise by revolving one or more curves around an axis.
      We first consider a familiar shape in <xref ref="PA-6-2">Example</xref>: a circular cone.

      <title>The Volume of a Solid of Revolution</title>

      <idx><h>solid of revolution</h></idx>
      <p permid="OxV">
        A solid of revolution is a three dimensional solid that can be generated by revolving one or more curves around a fixed axis.
        For example, the circular cone in <xref ref="F-PA-6-2">Figure</xref> is the solid of revolution generated by revolving the portion of the line <m>y = 3 - \frac{3}{5}x</m> from <m>x = 0</m> to <m>x = 5</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis.
        Notice that if we slice a solid of revolution perpendicular to the axis of revolution, the resulting cross-section is a circle.
      </p>

      <p permid="uFe">
        We first consider solids whose slices are thin cylinders.
        Recall that the volume of a cylinder is given by <m>V = \pi r^2 h</m>.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="Ex-6-2-Disks" permid="bhM">
        <statement>
          <p permid="dGT">
            Find the volume of the solid of revolution generated when the region <m>R</m> bounded by <m>y = 4-x^2</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis is revolved about the <m>x</m>-axis.

        </statement>

        <solution permid="Yng">
          <p permid="eMm">
            First, we observe that <m>y = 4-x^2</m> intersects the <m>x</m>-axis at the points <m>(-2,0)</m> and <m>(2,0)</m>.
            When we revolve the region <m>R</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis, we get the three-dimensional solid pictured in <xref ref="F-6-2-Ex1">Figure</xref>.

            </figure>

            <p permid="KTv">
              We slice the solid into vertical slices of thickness <m>\Delta x</m> between <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x = 2</m>.
              A representative slice is a cylinder of height <m>\Delta x</m> and radius <m>4-x^2</m>.
              Hence, the volume of the slice is
              <me permid="DYQ">
                V_{\text{slice} } = \pi (4-x^2)^2 \Delta x

            <p permid="raE">
              Using a definite integral to sum the volumes of the representative slices, it follows that

            <p permid="XhN">
              It is straightforward to evaluate the integral and find that the volume is <m>V = \frac{512}{15}\pi</m>.

          </solution>
        </example>

        <p permid="aMn">
          For a solid such as the one in <xref ref="Ex-6-2-Disks">Example</xref>, where each slice is a cylindrical disk, we first find the volume of a typical slice (noting particularly how this volume depends on <m>x</m>), and then integrate over the range of <m>x</m>-values that bound the solid.
          Often, we will be content with simply finding the integral that represents the volume; if we desire a numeric value for the integral, we typically use a calculator or computer algebra system to find that value.
        </p>

        <p permid="GTw">
          This method for finding the volume of a solid of revolution is often called the <em>disk method</em>.

          A different type of solid can emerge when two curves are involved, as we see in the following example.

          <solution permid="Eup">
            <p permid="jwf">
              First, we must determine where the curves <m>y = 4-x^2</m> and <m>y = x+2</m> intersect.
              Substituting the expression for <m>y</m> from the second equation into the first equation, we find that <m>x + 2 = 4-x^2</m>.
              Rearranging, it follows that

                x^2 + x - 2 = 0

              and the solutions to this equation are <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x = 1</m>.
              The curves therefore cross at <m>(-2,0)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>.
            </p>

            <p permid="PDo">
              When we revolve the region <m>R</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis, we get the three-dimensional solid pictured at left in <xref ref="F-6-2-Ex2">Figure</xref>.

                If we slice the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution, we observe that the resulting slice is not a solid disk, but rather a <em>washer</em>, as pictured at right in <xref ref="F-6-2-Ex2">Figure</xref>.
                At a given location <m>x</m> between <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x = 1</m>, the small radius <m>r(x)</m> of the inner circle is determined by the curve <m>y = x+2</m>, so <m>r(x) = x+2</m>.
                Similarly, the big radius <m>R(x)</m> comes from the function <m>y = 4-x^2</m>, and thus <m>R(x) = 4-x^2</m>.

                We can also use the definite integral to find the length of a portion of a curve.
                We use the same fundamental principle: we slice the curve up into small pieces whose lengths we can easily approximate.
                Specifically, we subdivide the curve into small approximating line segments, as shown at left in <xref ref="F-6-1-ArcLength">Figure</xref>.

                  The length, <m>h</m>, of the hypotenuse approximates the length, <m>L_{\text{slice} }</m>, of the curve between the two selected points.

                  The same technique can be applied to parametric curves.
                  For now consider a curve <m>(x(t), y(t))</m> travelling in just two dimensions (but see <xref ref="Ex-3D-Curve">Example</xref> for curves in 3D).
                  As before, the length of a small segment will be <m>\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2}</m>, but here we will factor out <m>\Delta t</m> to get:
                  <me>
                    L_{slice}\approx \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \right)^2+\left(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} \right)^2} \cdot \Delta t
                  </me>
                  Now, taking the limit as <m>\Delta t \rightarrow 0 </m>, <m>\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}</m> and <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}</m> turn into <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m>, so the length of the segment is

                        A definite integral may be used to represent the volume of a solid.
                        The idea is to slice the solid into thin shapes whose volume is easy to calculate.
                        The volume of each slice is found by taking the area of the cross-section and multiplying it by the width.
                        Summing up the volumes of the slices and taking the limit as the width <m> \rightarrow 0 </m> results in an integral representing the volume.

                        We can use a definite integral to find the volume of such a solid  by taking slices perpendicular to the axis of revolution.
                        The slices  will be circular disks or washers.

                        Normally, this shift involves taking a sum or difference of the function along with the constant connected to the equation for the horizontal or vertical line; a well-labeled diagram is usually the best way to decide the new expression for the radius.

                                              Because we are revolving about <m>y = -1</m>, the outer radius is <m>R(x) = 2+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2</m>, while the inner radius is <m>1+\frac{1}{2}x^2</m>.

                                              The radius of the disks changes as <m>y</m> passes through <m>f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{8} = 1.125</m>, so we need two different integrals to find the total volume.
                                              Since we are slicing horizontally, we will integrate with respect to <m>y</m>, so we  need to solve both of our equations for <m>x</m> as functions of <m>y</m>.
                                              Observe that <m>y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2 </m> implies <m>2(y-1) = (x-2)^2</m>, so <m>x-2 = \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m> and thus <m>x = 2 \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m>, and similarly <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> implies <m>x = \pm \sqrt{2y}</m>.
                                              The portion of the curve defined by <m>y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2</m> that determines one of the boundaries is the left hand portion of the parabola, so <m>x = 2 - \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m>, while the portion of the curve <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> that determines the other boundary is the right hand portion of the parabola, so <m>x = \sqrt{2y}</m>.
                                              These two curves define the radius of the disk (one for <m>y \lt 1.125</m>, the other for <m>y \gt 1.125</m>) and the lowest point on the region is <m>(0,0)</m> while the highest is <m>(0,3)</m>.
                                              So a sum of integrals that represents the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region <m>R</m> around the <m>y</m>-axis is
