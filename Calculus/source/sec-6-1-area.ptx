  <introduction permid="wBv">
    <p permid="EPO">
      Early on in our work with the definite integral,
      we learned that for an object moving along an axis,
      the area under a non-negative velocity function <m>v</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> tells us the distance the object traveled on that time interval,
      and that area is given precisely by the definite integral <m>\int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m>.
      In general, for any nonnegative function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m> measures the area bounded by the curve and the <m>x</m>-axis between <m>x = a</m> and <m>x = b</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="kWX">
      Next,
      we will explore how definite integrals can be used to represent other physically important quantities.
      In <xref ref="PA-6-1">Example</xref>,
      we investigate how a single definite integral may be used to represent the area between two curves. Later in this section,
	  we will also investigate how a single definite integral may be used to represent the volume of certain nice 3-dimensional shapes.

    <title>The Area Between Two Curves</title>

    <p permid="Reg">
      In <xref ref="PA-6-1"> Example</xref>,
      we saw a natural way to think about the area between two curves:
      it is the area beneath the upper curve minus the area below the lower curve.

      <solution permid="cIE">
        <p permid="WTs">
          In <xref ref="F-6-1-PA1revisited">Figure</xref>,
          we see that the graphs intersect at <m>(0,2)</m> and <m>(3,5)</m>.
          We can find these intersection points algebraically by solving the system of equations given by
          <m>y = x+2</m> and <m>y = (x-1)^2 + 1</m>:
          substituting <m>x+2</m> for <m>y</m> in the second equation yields <m>x+2 = (x-1)^2 + 1</m>,
          so <m>x+2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1</m>, and thus
          <me permid="DKv">
            x^2 - 3x = x(x-3) = 0

          from which it follows that <m>x = 0</m> or <m>x = 3</m>.
          Using <m>y = x+2</m>,
          we find the corresponding <m>y</m>-values of the intersection points.

        <p permid="DaB">
          On the interval <m>[0,3]</m>,
          the area beneath <m>g</m> is

        <p permid="jhK">
          Thus, the area between the curves is

            A = \int_0^3 (x+2) \, dx -  \int_0^3 [(x-1)^2 + 1] \, dx = \frac{21}{2} - 6 = \frac{9}{2}

        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    
    <p permid="xlp">
      We can also think of the area this way:
      if we slice up the region between two curves into thin vertical rectangles
      (in the same spirit as we originally sliced the region between a single curve and the <m>x</m>-axis in <xref ref="sec-4-2-Riemann">Section</xref>),
      we see (as shown in <xref ref="F-6-1-PA1revisited2">Figure</xref>) that the height of a typical rectangle is given by the difference between the two functions,
      <m>g(x) - f(x)</m>,
      and its width is <m>\Delta x</m>.
      Thus the area of the rectangle is
      <me permid="cnf">
        A_{\text{rect} } = (g(x) - f(x)) \Delta x
      </me>.
    </p>
    
    <figure xml:id="F-6-1-PA1revisited2" permid="icr">
      <caption> On the left is an example of a rectangular vertical slice. The right figure shows the area bounded by the functions <m>f(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1</m> and <m>g(x) = x+2</m> on the interval <m>[0,3]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/6_1_PA1revisited2" />
    </figure>
    
    <p permid="dsy">
      The area between the two curves on <m>[0,3]</m> is thus approximated by the Riemann sum
      <me permid="Iuo">
        A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} (g(x_i) - f(x_i)) \Delta x
      </me>,
      and as we let <m>n \to \infty</m>,
      it follows that the area is given by the single definite integral
      <men xml:id="E-IntOfDiff" permid="oBx">
        A = \int_0^3 (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx
      </men>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="JzH">
      We will see this strategy many times in the following sections: take a
      <q>representative slice</q>,
      approximate its area in terms of <m>\Delta x</m>, sum them up, and then take a limit.
      When we do so, the sum will change to an integral and <m>\Delta x</m> will turn into a <m>dx</m>.
      Here, the integral sums the areas of thin rectangles.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="pGQ">
      Finally, it doesn't matter whether we think of the area between two curves as the difference between the area bounded by the individual curves
      (as in<nbsp /><xref ref="E-DiffOfInt" />)
      or as the limit of a Riemann sum of the areas of thin rectangles between the curves
      (as in<nbsp /><xref ref="E-IntOfDiff" />).
      These two results are the same,
      since the difference of two integrals is the integral of the difference:
      <me permid="UIG">
        \int_0^3 g(x) \, dx -  \int_0^3 f(x) \, dx = \int_0^3 (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx

      Our work so far in this section illustrates the following general principle.

    <title> Volume as the Integral of Cross-Sectional Area </title>
    
    
    <p>
      So far in this section, we have seen that we could compute the area of a 2D region by slicing it into thin rectangles and then integrating the area of these rectangles.
      The same principle suggests a method for computing the volume of a 3D shape: slice it into thin <q> cross-sections </q>, and then integrate the volume of the cross-sections.
      When computing area, this perspective gave us the formula
      
      <me>
        \text{Area}= \int_a^b f(x)\, dx
      </me>
      
      where <m> f(x)\, dx </m> is the area of the thin rectangle at <m> x </m> and <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> are the endpoints of the interval. The analogous formula for volume is
      
      <me>
        \text{Volume}= \int_a^b A(x)\, dx
      </me>
      
      where <m> A(x)\, dx </m> is the volume of the thin cross-section at <m> x </m> and <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> are the endpoints of the interval. Consider the following example.

	<p>
      In <xref ref="PA-6-1-added">Example</xref>, we saw that the cross-sections were cylinders with radius <m> -\frac{3}{5}x + 3 </m>, so the volume of a thin cross section was given by <m>A(x)\,dx=\pi (-\frac 35 x +3)^2 \, dx</m>,
      and integrated from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=5</m> since those corresponded to the top and bottom of the cone.

      For 2D shapes it is sometimes more convenient to integrate with respect to <m>y</m> instead of <m>x</m>.
      The same is true for 3D shapes: 
      integrals may be taken with respect to <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m>. When choosing the variable of integration, priority should be given to variables which result in cross sections with simple shapes, so that
	  the area of the cross sections remains easy to compute and later integrate. For instance, in <xref ref="PA-6-1-added">Example</xref>, we integrated with respect to <m>x</m> so that the cross-sections were all circles.
	  If we had taken slices in another direction, the area of a cross-section would have been much more complicated and the integral would have been much harder!

            To find the area between two curves,
            we think about slicing the region into thin rectangles.
            If, for instance,
            the area of a typical rectangle on the interval <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m> is given by <m>A_{\text{rect} } = (g(x) - f(x)) \Delta x</m>,

            The shape of the region usually dictates whether we should use vertical rectangles of thickness
            <m>\Delta x</m> or horizontal rectangles of thickness <m>\Delta y</m>.
            We want the height of the rectangle given by the difference between two curves:
            if those curves are best thought of as functions of <m>y</m>,
            we use horizontal rectangles,
            whereas if those curves are best viewed as functions of <m>x</m>,

      A definite integral may be used to represent the volume of a solid. The idea is to slice the solid into thin shapes whose volume is easy to calculate. The volume of each slice is found by taking the area of the cross-section and multiplying it by the width. Summing up the volumes of the slices and taking the limit as the width <m> \rightarrow 0 </m> results in an integral representing the volume.

          Both of these quadratic functions pass through the points <m>(-1,0)</m> and <m>(1,0)</m>,

                of the half-circle <m>x</m> units above the base of the half-cone. (Your answer will depend on <m>R</m> and <m>h</m>.)

              <p>
                Use your answer to the previous part to set up and evaluate an integral that gives the volume of the half-cone.
                (You may want to use the fact that a half-circle has area <m>\frac{\pi}{2}r^2</m>. Your answer will depend on <m>R</m> and <m>h</m>.)
