<li><p>On \([0.4,0.8]\text{,}\) the average velocity is \(AV_{[0.4,0.8]} = \frac{s(0.8)-s(0.4)}{0.8-0.4} = \frac{63.36-58.24}{0.4} = 12.8\) ft/sec. On \([0.7,0.8]\text{,}\) the average velocity is 8 ft/sec. The other average velocities are, respectively (in the order of the intervals listed in the activity), 6.56, 6.416, 0, 4.8, 6.24, 6.384, all measured in feet per second.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The slope of the line between \(A(0.4, s(0.4))\) and \(B(0.8, s(0.8))\) is \(\frac{s(0.8)-s(0.4)}{0.8-0.4} = 12.8\text{.}\) This is precisely the average velocity of the ball between \(t = 0.4\) and \(t = 0.8\text{,}\) and indeed each of the average velocities computed in (a) can be viewed as the slope of the line joining the points \((a,s(a))\) and \((b,s(b))\text{.}\)</p>

</li>
<li><p>As we zoom in on the curve \(s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2\) at the point \((0.5, 60)\text{,}\) the graph begins to look like a straight line. Indeed, it appears to look like a straight line with slope about 6.4.</p></li>
<li><p>Observe that the average velocity of the ball on the intervals \([0.799,0.8]\) and \([0.8,0.801]\) is 6.416 and 6.384 feet/sec respectively. Hence it appears that the ball's velocity at the instant \(t = 0.8\) should be about 6.4 feet per second.</p></li>
