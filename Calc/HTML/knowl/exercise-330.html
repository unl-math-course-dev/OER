<p>Congratulations, you just won the lottery! In one option presented to you, you will be paid one million dollars a year for the next 25 years. You can deposit this money in an account that will earn 5% each year. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Set up a differential equation that describes the rate of change in the amount of money in the account. Two factors cause the amount to grow—first, you are depositing one millon dollars per year and second, you are earning 5% interest.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no amount of money in the account when you open it, how much money will you have in the account after 25 years?</p></li>
<li><p>The second option presented to you is to take a lump sum of 10 million dollars, which you will deposit into a similar account. How much money will you have in that account after 25 years?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you prefer the first or second option? Explain your thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>At what time does the amount of money in the account under the first option overtake the amount of money in the account under the second option?</p></li>
