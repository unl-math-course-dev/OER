<p>In most of our applications of the derivative so far, we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable, say \(y\text{,}\) changes with respect to another, say \(x\text{,}\) leading us to compute and interpret \(\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}\) We next consider situations where several variable quantities are related, but where each quantity is implicitly a function of time, which will be represented by the variable \(t\text{.}\) Through knowing how the quantities are related, we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related.</p>
