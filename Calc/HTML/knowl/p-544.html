<p>We have noted that \(F'\) is always negative, and that we expect \(F'\) to get closer and closer to \(0\) as time goes on (that is, \(F'\) is increasing). As such, we expect \(F'\) to look something like the graph of \(y = -e^{-x}\text{.}\) This is reasonable since \(-e^{-x}\) is also an exponential function, is always negative, is always increasing, and approaches \(0\) as \(x\) increases.</p>
