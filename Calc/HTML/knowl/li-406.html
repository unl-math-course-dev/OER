<p>From the given graph of \(g'(x)\text{,}\) we observe that \(g'\) is undefined at \(x = -2, 0, 2\text{.}\) Since we have been given that \(g\) is a continuous function, we can conclude that \(g\) must have sharp corners on its graph at these points. Moreover, that makes sense in light of our earlier observations that show \(g\) has constant slope on the intervals that connect at \(x = -2, 0, 2\) and the graph jumps from having slope \(1\) to \(-1\text{,}\) and then back, and so on.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-1-4-derivative-fxn.html#li-406">in-context</a></span>
