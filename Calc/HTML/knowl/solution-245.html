<li>
<p>Observe that horizontal slices with thickness \(\Delta y\) are all cylindrical disks, each with radius given by \(r(y) = y^2\) since they are given by the curve \(y = \sqrt{x}\text{,}\) which can be equivalently expressed as \(x = y^2\text{.}\) The volume of each slice is thus</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi r(y)^2 \Delta y = \pi y^4 \Delta y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The volume of the solid is thus given by the definite integral</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^2 \pi y^4 \Delta \, dy\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slicing perpendicular to the axis of rotation, we get slices of thickness \(\Delta y\) that are shaped like washers. The outer radius, \(R(y)\text{,}\) is given by \(R(y) = 4\text{;}\) the innner radius is given by the function \(y = \sqrt{x}\text{,}\) but expressed with \(x\) as a function of \(y\text{,}\) so \(r(y) = y^2\text{.}\) It follows that a representative washer slice has volume</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) \Delta y = \pi (16 - y^4) \Delta y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Further, since \(y = \sqrt{x}\) and \(x = 4\) intersect at the point \((4,2)\text{,}\) we integrate from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 2\) and thus find that the total volume is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^2 \pi (16 - y^4) \, dy\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The curves \(y=x^3\) and \(y=2x\) intersect where \(x^3 = 2x\text{,}\) so where \(x^3-2x = x(x^2 - 2) = 0\text{.}\) The two nonnegative values of \(x\) that make this equation true are \(x=0\) and \(x=\sqrt{2}\text{,}\) and thus the points \((0,0)\) and \((\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})\) form the boundaries of the region \(S\) that is being rotated about the \(x\)-axis. Since we rotate about the horizontal axis, we slice perpendicular to that axis with slices of thickness \(\Delta x\text{.}\) A representative slice is in the shape of a washer and has volume</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(x)^2 - r(x)^2) \Delta x = \pi ( (2x)^2 - (x^3)^2 ) \Delta x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and thus the total volume of the solid is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = int_0^{\sqrt{2}} \pi ( 4x^2 - x^6 ) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To use the same region \(S\) as in part (c), but now revolved about the \(y\)-axis, we shift to horizontal slices of thickness \(\Delta y\text{,}\) and thus need to express the curves as functions of \(y\text{:}\) the rightmost curve is \(x = R(y) = \sqrt[3]{y}\text{,}\) while the leftmost curve is \(x = r(y) = \frac{1}{2}y\text{.}\) A representative slice is a washer whose volume is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) \Delta y = \pi( (\sqrt[3]{y})^2 - (\frac{1}{2}y)^2) \Delta y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>It follows that the total volume of the solid is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^{2\sqrt{2}} \pi( y^{2/3} - y^2/4 ) \, dy\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>For this pair of curves, we see they intersect where \(x=(y-1)^2\) and \(x = (y+1)\) are both true, and hence where \((y-1)^2 = y+1\text{.}\) Expanding, moving all terms to the left, and combining like terms, we see that \(y^2 - 2y + 1 = y + 1\text{,}\) so \(y^2 - 3y = 0\text{.}\) It follows that \(y(y-3) = 0\) and therefore \(y=3\) or \(y = 0\text{.}\) Plotting the region and revolving about the \(y\)-axis, we see that horizontal slices of thickness \(\Delta y\) are shaped like washers. The outer radius is given by \(R(y) = y+1\text{,}\) while the inner radius is \(r(y) = (y-1)^2\text{.}\) A representative slice thus has volume</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) \Delta y = \pi( (y+1)^2 - ((y-1)^2)^2 ) \Delta y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The volume of the solid of revolution is therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^3 \pi( (y+1)^2 - (y-1)^4 ) \, dy\text{.}
\end{equation*}
