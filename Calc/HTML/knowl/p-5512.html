<p>When building a dam, engineers need to know how much force water will exert against the face of the dam. This force comes from water pressure. The pressure a force exerts on a region is measured in units of force per unit of area: for example, the air pressure in a tire is often measured in pounds per square inch (PSI). Hence, we see that the general relationship is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{F}{A}, \ \text{or}  \ F = P \cdot A\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(P\) represents pressure, \(F\) represents force, and \(A\) the area of the region being considered. Of course, in the equation \(F = PA\text{,}\) we assume that the pressure is constant over the entire region \(A\text{.}\)</p>
