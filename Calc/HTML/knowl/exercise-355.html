<p>Suppose you play a game with a friend that involves rolling a standard six-sided die. Before a player can participate in the game, he or she must roll a six with the die. Assume that you roll first and that you and your friend take alternate rolls. In this exercise we will determine the probability that you roll the first six.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Explain why the probability of rolling a six on any single roll (including your first turn) is \(\frac{1}{6}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>If you don't roll a six on your first turn, then in order for you to roll the first six on your second turn, both you and your friend had to fail to roll a six on your first turns, and then you had to succeed in rolling a six on your second turn. Explain why the probability of this event is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now suppose you fail to roll the first six on your second turn. Explain why the probability is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>that you to roll the first six on your third turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The probability of you rolling the first six is the probability that you roll the first six on your first turn plus the probability that you roll the first six on your second turn plus the probability that your roll the first six on your third turn, and so on. Explain why this probability is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{6} + \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) +  \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + \cdots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Find the sum of this series and determine the probability that you roll the first six.</p>
