<p>Consider a thin bar of length 20 cm whose density is distributed according to the function \(\rho(x) = 4 + 0.1x\text{,}\) where \(x = 0\) represents the left end of the bar. Assume that \(\rho\) is measured in g/cm and \(x\) is measured in cm. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find the total mass, \(M\text{,}\) of the bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Without doing any calculations, do you expect the center of mass of the bar to be equal to 10, less than 10, or greater than 10? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Compute \(\overline{x}\text{,}\) the exact center of mass of the bar.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the average density of the bar?</p></li>
<li><p>Now consider a different density function, given by \(p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}\text{,}\) also for a bar of length 20 cm whose left end is at \(x = 0\text{.}\) Plot both \(\rho(x)\) and \(p(x)\) on the same axes. Without doing any calculations, which bar do you expect to have the greater center of mass? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the exact center of mass of the bar described in (e) whose density function is \(p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}\text{.}\) Check the result against the prediction you made in (e).</p></li>
