<p>In addition to asking <em class="emphasis">whether</em> a function is increasing or decreasing, it is also natural to inquire <em class="emphasis">how</em> a function is increasing or decreasing. There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-3optsi.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-3optsi" alt="Figure 1.51 " title="Figure 1.51 ">FigureÂ 1.51</a>: the function can increase more and more rapidly, it can increase at the same rate, or it can increase in a way that is slowing down. Fundamentally, we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends, with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all. More than this, we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.</p>
