<li><p>Observe that \(g'\) is always positive. This tells us that \(g\) must be always increasing. Therefore, it follows that \(g\) may cross the \(x\)-axis at most one time, and hence there can be at most one solution to \(g(x) = 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>On \(-3 \lt x \lt 3\text{,}\) \(g\) changes concavity \(g\) times, since \(g'\) changes from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing \(9\) times. Whenever \(g'\) is increasing, \(g''\) is positive, and whenever \(g'\) is decreasing, \(g''\) is negative. Hence, whenever \(g'\) changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it follows that \(g''\) changes sign, and this causes a change in the concavity of \(g\text{.}\) We therefore see that while \(g\) is always increasing, \(g\) changes concavity many times.</p></li>

<p>From the given graph of \(g'\text{,}\) we can see that \(g'(1.9) \approx 0.9\) and \(g'(2.1) \approx 2\text{.}\) Using a central difference, it follows that</p>

\begin{equation*}
g''(2) \approx \frac{g'(2.1) - g(1.9)}{0.2} \approx \frac{2-0.9}{0.2} = 5.5\text{.}
