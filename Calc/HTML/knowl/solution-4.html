<li>We make the assumptions that \(-0.5 \lt  h \lt  0.5\) and \(h \ne 0\) because \(h\) cannot be zero (otherwise there is no interval on which to compute average velocity) and because the function only makes sense on the time interval \(0 \le t \le 1\text{,}\) as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling. We want to compute and simplify<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>We start by finding \(s(0.5+h)\text{.}\) To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function \(s\text{.}\)<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
s(0.5+h) \amp  =  16 - 16(0.5 + h)^2\\
\amp  =  16 - 16(0.25 + h + h^2)\\
\amp  =  16 - 4 - 16h - 16h^2\\
\amp  =  12 - 16h - 16h^2\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity, we find that<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} \amp  =  \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}\\
\amp  =  \frac{(12 - 16h - 16h^2) - (16 - 16(0.5)^2)}{0.5 + h - 0.5}\\
\amp  =  \frac{12 - 16h - 16h^2 - 12}{h}\\
\amp  =  \frac{-16h - 16h^2}{h}\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>At this point, we note two things: first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on \(h\text{,}\) which it must, since as \(h\) changes the average velocity will change. Further, we note that since \(h\) can never equal zero, we may remove the common factor of \(h\) from the numerator and denominator. It follows that<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = -16 - 16h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>From this expression we can compute the average for any small positive or negative value of \(h\text{.}\) For instance, to obtain the average velocity on \([0.5,0.75]\text{,}\) we let \(h = 0.25\text{,}\) and the average velocity is \(-16 - 16(0.25) = -20\) ft/sec. To get the average velocity on \([0.4, 0.5]\text{,}\) we let \(h = -0.1\text{,}\) and compute the average velocity as<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
-16 - 16(-0.1) = -14.4\ \text{ft/sec}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>We can even explore what happens to \(AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]}\) as \(h\) gets closer and closer to zero. As \(h\) approaches zero, \(-16h\) will also approach zero, so it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at \(t = 0.5\) should be \(-16\) ft/sec.</li>
