<li>
<p>Treating \(m\) and \(s\) as constants, by the chain rule,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
E'(x) = e^{-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}\left[ -\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2} \right] = e^{-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}} \cdot \left[ -\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} \right]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that \(E'(x)\) is defined for every value of \(x\text{,}\) thus the only critical numbers occur where \(E'(x) = 0\text{.}\) Since \(e\) raised to any power is never zero, the only way that \(E'(x) = 0\) is for \(\left[ -\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} \right] = 0\text{,}\) which implies that \(x = m\text{.}\) Thus, \(x = m\) is the only critical number of \(E\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>As we noted in (a), \(x = m\) is the only critical number of \(E\text{.}\) More over, since \(e\) to any power is always positive, the sign of \(E'(x)\) depends entirely on the expression \(-\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} = -\frac{1}{2}(x-m)\text{.}\) This linear function of \(x\) has negative slope, and thus is positive for \(x \lt m\) and negative for \(x \gt m\text{,}\) and thus \(E'(x)\) is positive for \(x \lt m\) and negative for \(x \gt m\text{.}\) Therefore, \(E\) is increasing for \(x \lt m\) and decreasing for \(x \gt m\text{,}\) with a local maximum at \(x = m\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>From the given formula for \(E''(x)\) and our knowledge that \(e\) to any power is positive, the only way \(E''(x) = 0\) is for</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{(x-m)^2 - s^2}{s^4} \right) = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which implies that \((x-m)^2 = s^2\text{,}\) and therefore \(x-m = \pm s\text{,}\) or \(x = m \pm s\text{.}\) These are the two values for which \(E''(x) = 0\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>As \(x \to \pm \infty\text{,}\) we know that the quadratic function \(-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}\) must decrease without bound because the quadratic function opens down. Thus, the power to which we are raising \(e\) in the formula for \(E(x)\) is decreasing without bound, which means that \(E(x)\) must approach \(0\) since raising \(e\) to more and more negative numbers drives the result to \(0\text{.}\) Thus, \(\lim_{x \to \infty} E(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} E(x) = 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>We've shown that \(E\) has a single critical number at \(x = m\) and two potential points of inflection at \(x = m \pm s\text{,}\) as well as that \(E(x) \to 0\) as \(x \to \pm \infty\text{.}\) All of these properties are reflected in the following figure.</p>
