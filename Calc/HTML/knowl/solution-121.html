<li><p>Based on the given graph of \(g''\text{,}\) the only point at which \(g''\) changes sign is \(x = -1\text{,}\) and hence this is an inflection point of \(g\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Note that \(g''(x) \gt 0\) for \(x \lt -1\text{,}\) \(g''(x) \lt 0\) for \(-1 \lt x \lt 2\text{,}\) and \(g''(x) \lt 0\) for \(x \gt 2\text{.}\) This tells us that \(g\) is concave up for \(x \lt -1\text{,}\) concave down for \(-1 \lt x \lt 2\text{,}\) and concave down for \(x \gt 2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Given that \(g'(-1.67857351) = 0\text{,}\) we know that \(g\) has a horizontal tangent line at this critical number. In addition, from the given graph of \(g''\text{,}\) we see that \(g''( -1.67857351) \gt 0\) and observe that \(g\) is concave up at \(x\)-values near \(-1.67857351\text{.}\) By the second derivative test, \(g\) has a local minimum at \(x = -1.67857351\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>From the given graph, since \(g''\) has a simple zero at \(x = -1\) and a repeated zero at \(x = 2\text{,}\) it appears that \(g''\) is a degree 3 polynomial. If so, then \(g'\) is a degree 4 polynomial, and \(g\) is a degree 5 polynomial.</p></li>
