<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-2Dtest.html" knowl-id="xref-F-3-1-2Dtest" alt="Figure 3.9 " title="Figure 3.9 ">Figure 3.9</a>, we see the four possibilities for a function \(f\) that has a critical number \(p\) at which \(f'(p) = 0\text{,}\) provided \(f''(p)\) is not zero on an interval including \(p\) (except possibly at \(p\)). On either side of the critical number, \(f''\) can be either positive or negative, and hence \(f\) can be either concave up or concave down. In the first two graphs, \(f\) does not change concavity at \(p\text{,}\) and in those situations, \(f\) has either a local minimum or local maximum. In particular, if \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) \lt 0\text{,}\) then \(f\) is concave down at \(p\) with a horizontal tangent line, so \(f\) has a local maximum there. This fact, along with the corresponding statement for when \(f''(p)\) is positive, is the substance of the <em class="emphasis">second derivative test</em>.</p>
