<li><p>\(g\) has neither a local maximum nor local minimum at \(x = 2\) because \(f'\) does not change sign at \(x = 2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Because \(g'(2) = 0\) and \(g'\) is positive for \(1 \lt x \lt 2\) and for \(2 \lt x \lt 3\text{,}\) it must be that \(g'\) is decreasing for \(1 \lt x \lt 2\) and \(g'\) is increasing for \(2 \lt x \lt 3\text{.}\) Since \(g'\) changes from decreasing to increasing at \(x = 2\text{,}\) it follows that \(g'\) has a local minimum at \(x = 2\) and thus \(g''(2) = 0\text{.}\) In addition, \(g''(x)\) must change sign from negative to positive at \(x = 2\text{.}\) In particular, \(g''\) is negative for \(1 \lt x \lt 2\) and positive for \(2 \lt x \lt 3\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(g\) has a horizontal tangent line at \(x = 2\text{,}\) is increasing before \(x = 2\) and decreasing after \(x = 2\text{,}\) and concave down before \(x = 2\) and concave up after \(x = 2\text{,}\) and thus \(g\) has a point of inflection at \(x = 2\text{.}\)</p></li>
