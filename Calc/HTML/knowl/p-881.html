<p>But the function \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-7-NotDiff.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-7-NotDiff" alt="Figure 1.65 " title="Figure 1.65 ">Figure 1.65</a> is not differentiable at \(a = 1\) because \(f'(1)\) fails to exist. One way to see this is to observe that \(f'(x) = -1\) for every value of \(x\) that is less than 1, while \(f'(x) = +1\) for every value of \(x\) that is greater than 1. That makes it seem that either \(+1\) or \(-1\) would be equally good candidates for the value of the derivative at \(x = 1\text{.}\) Alternately, we could use the limit definition of the derivative to attempt to compute \(f'(1)\text{,}\) and discover that the derivative does not exist. Finally, we can see visually that the function \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-7-NotDiff.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-7-NotDiff" alt="Figure 1.65 " title="Figure 1.65 ">Figure 1.65</a> does not have a tangent line. When we zoom in on \((1,1)\) on the graph of \(f\text{,}\) no matter how closely we examine the function, it will always look like a “V”, and never like a single line, which tells us there is no possibility for a tangent line there.</p>
