<p>Now suppose she walks in the following manner. From the outset at \(t = 0\text{,}\) she walks due east at a constant rate of \(3\) mph for 1.5 hours. After 1.5 hours, she stops abruptly and begins walking due west at a constant rate of \(4\) mph and does so for 0.5 hours. Then, after another abrupt stop and start, she resumes walking at a constant rate of \(3\) mph to the east for one more hour. What is the total distance she traveled on the time interval from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 3\text{?}\) What the total change in her position over that time?</p>
