<p>A typical slice is a thin cylinder of radius 2 and thickness \(\Delta x\text{.}\) The volume of such a cylinder is \(V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (2)^2 \Delta x\text{,}\) and its weight is thus \(F_{\text{slice}} = 1000 \cdot 9.8 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 4000 \pi \Delta x\text{.}\) Finally, the distance such a slice travels to the top of the tank is \(d_{\text{slice}} = x\text{.}\) If we only pump out the top 1 m of water, it follows that the total work is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_{0}^{1} 9.8 \cdot 4000\pi \cdot x \, dx = 19600 \pi \, \text{newton-meters}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>

<p>Viewing the tank as a solid of revolution, the tank is generated by the function \(R(x) = \sqrt{100-x^2}\text{,}\) and a typical slice has volume \(V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (\sqrt{100-x^2})^2 \Delta x\text{.}\) The force to move such a slice is its weight, \(F_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \pi (100-x^2) \Delta x\text{.}\) Each slice has to move \(x\) feet to clear the top of the tank, and then an additional 5 feet up to the truck, so the distance each slice moves is \(d_{\text{slice}} = x + 5\text{.}\) Finally, since the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet, and we wish to pump out the top 5 feet, \(x\) ranges from \(x=3\) (the top of the water) to \(x=8\) (the point at which there are 2 feet remaining in the tank). Hence, the total work done is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_{3}^{8} 62.4 \pi (100-x^2)(x+5) \, dx \approx 673593 \, \text{foot-pounds}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>

<p>The line that bounds the right edge of the triangular face of the tank lying in the first quadrant is \(y=\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x\text{.}\) If we take a slice of water that lies at depth \(x\text{,}\) note that the slice is rectangular with thickness \(\Delta x\text{,}\) length 10 (the tank is 10 feet long), and width \(2(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x)\text{.}\) Thus, the volume of a typical slice is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = 10 \cdot 2(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x) \cdot \Delta x = (50 - \frac{25}{2}x) \Delta x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and the force that has to be exerted to move such a slice is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 (50 - \frac{25}{2}x) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The distance a typical slice moves when pumped to the top of the tank is \(d_{\text{slice}} = x\text{,}\) and since the tank is full to a depth of 3 feet (within 1 foot of the top) and we are going to empty the tank until 1 foot of water remains in it, we see that we need to integrate from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\text{,}\) so</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_{1}^{3} 62.4 (50 - \frac{25}{2}x) x \, dx = 5720 \, \text{foot-pounds}\text{.}
