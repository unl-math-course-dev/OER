<p>Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative, and the definition of the derivative involves a limit, there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits. In addition, the limit involved in the definition of the derivative always generates the indeterminate form \(\frac{0}{0}\text{.}\) If \(f\) is a differentiable function, thenin the definition</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>not only does \(h \to 0\) in the denominator, but also \((f(x+h)-f(x)) \to 0\) in the numerator, since \(f\) is continuous. Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do: indeed, limits of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\) can take on any value, as is evidenced by evaluating \(f'(x)\) for varying values of \(x\) for a function such as \(f'(x) = x^2\text{.}\)</p>
