<li>The derivative of \(f\) at the value \(x = a\) is defined as the limit of the average rate of change of \(f\) on the interval \([a,a+h]\) as \(h \to 0\text{.}\) This limit may not exist, so not every function has a derivative at every point.</li>
<li>We say that a function is <em class="emphasis">differentiable</em>  at \(x = a\) if it has a derivative at \(x = a\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The derivative is a generalization of the instantaneous velocity of a position function: if \(y = s(t)\) is a position function of a moving body, \(s'(a)\) tells us the instantaneous velocity of the body at time \(t=a\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Because the units on \(\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\) are “units of \(f(x)\) per unit of \(x\text{,}\)” the derivative has these very same units. For instance, if \(s\) measures position in feet and \(t\) measures time in seconds, the units on \(s'(a)\) are feet per second.</li>
<li>Because the quantity \(\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\) represents the slope of the line through \((a,f(a))\) and \((a+h, f(a+h))\text{,}\) when we compute the derivative we are taking the limit of a collection of slopes of lines. Thus, the derivative itself represents the slope of a particularly important line.</li>
