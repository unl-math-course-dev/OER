<li><p>The tax cut of \(P\) dollars is income for its recipient. How much of this tax cut will be spent?</p></li>
<li><p>In this simple model, we will say that the spent portion of the tax cut/rebate from part (a) then becomes income for another person who, in turn, spends 75% of this income. After this ``second round" of spent income, how many total dollars have been added to the economy as a result of the original tax cut/rebate?</p></li>
<li>
<p>This second round of spending becomes income for another group who spend 75% of this income, and so on. In economics this is called the <em class="emphasis">multiplier effect</em>. Explain why an original tax cut/rebate of \(P\) dollars will result in multiplied spending of</p>

<li><p>Based on these assumptions, how much stimulus will a 200 billion dollar tax cut/rebate to consumers add to the economy, assuming consumer spending remains consistent forever.</p></li>
