<p>If a spherical tank of radius 4 feet has \(h\) feet of water present in the tank, then the volume of water in the tank is given by the formula</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = \frac{\pi}{3} h^2(12-h)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>At what instantaneous rate is the volume of water in the tank changing with respect to the <em class="emphasis">height</em> of the water at the instant \(h = 1\text{?}\) What are the units on this quantity?</p></li>
<li><p>Now suppose that the height of water in the tank is being regulated by an inflow and outflow (e.g., a faucet and a drain) so that the height of the water at time \(t\) is given by the rule \(h(t) = \sin(\pi t) + 1\text{,}\) where \(t\) is measured in hours (and \(h\) is still measured in feet). At what rate is the height of the water changing with respect to time at the instant \(t = 2\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing under the assumptions in (b), at what instantaneous rate is the volume of water in the tank changing with respect to <em class="emphasis">time</em> at the instant \(t = 2\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What are the main differences between the rates found in (a) and (c)? Include a discussion of the relevant units.</p></li>
