<p>Treating \(k\) as an arbitrary constant, we first observe that \(h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)\text{.}\) Again treating \(k\) as a constant and differentiating, we find</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h''(x) = 2 - k^2\cos(kx)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We seek the values of \(x\) for which \(h''(x) = 0\) at which \(h''\) changes sign. Setting \(h''(x) = 0\) and rearranging the resulting equation, we now seek \(x\) such that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k^2 \cos(kx) = 2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, remember that \(k\) is an arbitrary positive constant and recall that \(-1 \le \cos(\theta) \le 1\) for all input values \(\theta\text{.}\) If \(\frac{2}{k^2} \gt 1\text{,}\) then the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solution. Hence, whenever \(k^2 \lt  2\text{,}\) or \(k \lt  \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\text{,}\) it follows that the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solutions \(x\text{,}\) which means that \(h''(x)\) is never zero (indeed, for these \(k\)-values, \(h''(x)\) is always positive so that \(h\) is always concave up). On the other hand, if \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\text{,}\) then \(\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1\text{,}\) which guarantees that \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has infinitely many solutions, due to the periodicity of the cosine function. At each such point, \(h''(x) = 2 - k^2 \cos(kx)\) changes sign, and therefore \(h\) has infinitely many inflection points whenever \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-1-tests.html#li-1781">in-context</a></span>
