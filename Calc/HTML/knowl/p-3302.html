<p>In the figure below, at left we list all of the areas bounded by \(v\) on each one-unit subinterval. Along with the given starting point that \(s(0) = 1\text{,}\) we use the resulting changes in position to plot points for the function \(s\text{.}\) For instance, we know \(s(1) - s(0) = 1\text{,}\) hence \(s(1) = 2\text{.}\) Similarly, \(s(2) - s(1) = -1\text{,}\) thus \(s(2) = 1\text{.}\) Continuing across the interval, we generate the function \(s\) that is pictured at right. Note that the portion of \(s\) from \(t = 2\) to \(t = 3\) is linear because \(v\) is constant there, while the other parts of \(s\) appear to be quadratic, as they correspond to intervals where \(v\) is linear.</p>
