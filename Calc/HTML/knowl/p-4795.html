<p>We know from the definition of the definite integral that if we let \(n\) be large enough, we can make any of the approximations \(L_n\text{,}\) \(R_n\text{,}\) and \(M_n\) as close as we'd like (in theory) to the exact value of \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\text{.}\) Thus, it may be natural to wonder why we ever use any rule other than \(L_n\) or \(R_n\) (with a sufficiently large \(n\) value) to estimate a definite integral. One of the primary reasons is that as \(n \to \infty\text{,}\) \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n} \to 0\text{,}\) and thus in a Riemann sum calculation with a large \(n\) value, we end up multiplying by a number that is very close to zero. Doing so often generates roundoff error, because representing numbers close to zero accurately is a persistent challenge for computers.</p>
