<li><p>Since \(\frac{dT}{dt}= -\frac1{15}T+5\) and \(T(0)=105\text{,}\) \(\frac{dT}{dt}\vert_{T=105} = -\frac{1}{15}(105) + 5 = -7 + 5 = -2\text{.}\) The fact that \(T(0) = 105\) tells us the coffee's temperature at time \(t = 0\) is \(T = 105\) degrees F, and \(\frac{dT}{dt}\vert_{T=105} = -2\) tells us that at the instant \(T = 105\) (i.e. when \(t = 0\)), the coffee's temperature is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of \(-2\) degrees F per minute.</p></li>
<li><p>At \(t = 0\text{,}\) \(T = 105\text{,}\) and since \(\frac{dT}{dt}\vert_{T=105}\) is negative, \(T\) decreasing at \(t=0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Using the linear approximation \(T(1) \approx T(0) + \frac{dT}{dt}\vert_{t=0} (1-0)\) along with the given information, it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
T(1) \approx 105 + (-2)(1) = 103
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>degrees F.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We note that \(\frac{dT}{dt}\) is a linear function of \(T\) with slope \(-\frac{1}{15}\) and vertical intercept \((0,5)\text{,}\) so its graph is as shown below. Note particularly that \(\frac{dT}{dt}\vert_{T = 75} = 0\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:25%;margin-right:25%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/7_1_Ez1Soln.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
</li>
<li><p>For \(T \lt 75\text{,}\) \(\frac{dT}{dt} \gt 0\text{,}\) so for these \(T\)-values, \(T\) increases. For \(T \gt 75\text{,}\) \(\frac{dT}{dt} \lt 0\text{,}\) so for these \(T\)-values, \(T\) decreases.</p></li>
<li><p>In the previous question, we observed that \(75\) degrees F is the critical temperature that changes the behavior of \(T\text{.}\) There are several reasons to think that \(75\) degrees F is room temperature: if the coffee's temperature is above room temperature (\(75\)), its temperature will decrease to room temperature, while if the coffee is below room temperature, its temperature will increase to room temperature. Moreover, if the coffee's temperature is \(75\) (which would match the room temperature), then its rate of change is \(0\) and the coffee's temperature doesn't change.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Verify that \(T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}\) is the solution to the differential equation with initial value \(T(0) = 105\text{.}\) What happens to this solution after a long time? Assuming that \(T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}\text{,}\) we observe that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt} = 30e^{-t/15} \left(-\frac{1}{15} \right) = -2e^{-t/15}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In addition,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{1}{15}T + 5 = -\frac{1}{15}(75 + 30e^{-t/15}) + 5 = -5 - 2e^{-t/15} + 5 = -2e^{-t/15}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The two preceding equations show that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt}= -\frac1{15}T+5
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>when we substitute \(T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}\) in for \(T\text{,}\) and thus this function is a solution to the differential equation. Moreover, \(T(0) = 75 + 30e^0 = 75 + 30 = 105\text{,}\) so the function satisfies the initial condition, too. Finally, because \(e^{-t/15} \to 0\) as \(t \to \infty\text{,}\) it follows that \(T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15} \to 75\) as \(t \to \infty\text{,}\) which shows that the solution function's value tends to room temperature as time increases without bound, as we expect.</p>
