<p>Since \(AV_{[1.499,1.5]} = -15.984\) and \(AV_{[1.5, 1.501]} = -16.016\text{,}\) it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at \(t = 1.5\) is approximately \(-16\) ft/sec. Similar computations show that at \(t = 2\text{,}\) it appears the instantaneous velocity is about \(-32\) ft/sec. Note that \(-16&gt;-32\text{,}\) so the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 1.5\) is greater because it is “less negative.” Asking which number is “greater” is different from asking which number is “more negative.”</p>
