<p>For any function \(f\text{,}\) there are typically three ways to answer the question “does \(f\) have a limit at \(x = a\text{,}\) and if so, what is the limit?” The first is to reason graphically as we have just done with the example from <a knowl="./knowl/PA-1-2.html" knowl-id="xref-PA-1-2" alt="Exploration 1.4 " title="Exploration 1.4 ">Preview Activity 1.4</a>. If we have a formula for \(f(x)\text{,}\) there are two additional possibilities: </p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Evaluate the function at a sequence of inputs that approach \(a\) on either side (typically using some sort of computing technology), and ask if the sequence of outputs seems to approach a single value.</li>
<li>Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach \(a\text{.}\)</li>
</ol>
<p> The first approach produces only an approximation of the value of the limit, while the latter can often be used to determine the limit exactly.</p>
