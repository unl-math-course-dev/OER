<body><span class="solution"><p>Since we already have \(f'(x)\) written in factored form, it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of \(f\text{.}\) Because \(f'(x)\) is defined for all values of \(x\text{,}\) we need only determine where \(f'(x) = 0\text{.}\) From the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2 = 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and the zero product property, it follows that \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) are critical numbers of \(f\text{.}\) (There is no value of \(x\) that makes \(e^{-2x} = 0\text{.}\))</p>
<p>Next, to apply the first derivative test, we'd like to know the sign of \(f'(x)\) at inputs near the critical numbers. Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which \(f'\) can change sign, it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers: for instance, the sign of \(f'\) must be the same for every \(x \lt -1\text{.}\) We create a first derivative sign chart to summarize the sign of \(f'\) on the relevant intervals, along with the corresponding behavior of \(f\text{.}\)</p>

For instance, for \(x \lt -1\text{,}\) we could determine the sign of \(e^{-2x}\text{,}\) \((3-x)\text{,}\) and \((x+1)^2\) at the value \(x = -2\text{.}\) We note that both \(e^{-2x}\) and \((x+1)^2\) are positive regardless of the value of \(x\text{,}\) while \((3-x)\) is also positive at \(x = -2\text{.}\) Hence, each of the three terms in \(f'\) is positive, which we indicate by writing “\(+++\text{.}\)” Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for \(f'\text{,}\) which we denote by the “\(+\)” in the interval to the left of \(x = -1\text{.}\) And, since \(f'\) is positive on that interval, we know that \(f\) is increasing, so we write “INC” to represent the behavior of \(f\text{.}\) In a similar way, we find that \(f'\) is positive and \(f\) is increasing on \(-1 \lt x \lt 3\text{,}\) and \(f'\) is negative and \(f\) is decreasing for \(x \gt 3\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now we look for critical numbers at which \(f'\) changes sign. In this example, \(f'\) changes sign only at \(x = 3\text{,}\) from positive to negative, so \(f\) has a relative maximum at \(x = 3\text{.}\) Although \(f\) has a critical number at \(x = -1\text{,}\) since \(f\) is increasing both before and after \(x = -1\text{,}\) \(f\) has neither a minimum nor a maximum at \(x = -1\text{.}\)</p></span></body>
