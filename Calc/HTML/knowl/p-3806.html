<p>Finally, before proceeding to build a list of common functions whose antiderivatives we know, we recall that each function has more than one antiderivative. Because the derivative of any constant is zero, we may add a constant of our choice to any antiderivative. For instance, we know that \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3\) is an antiderivative of \(g(x) = x^2\text{.}\) But we could also have chosen \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + 7\text{,}\) since in this case as well, \(G'(x) = x^2\text{.}\) If \(g(x) = x^2\text{,}\) we say that the <em class="emphasis">general antiderivative</em>  of \(g\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(C\) represents an arbitrary real number constant. Regardless of the formula for \(g\text{,}\) including \(+C\) in the formula for its antiderivative \(G\) results in the most general possible antiderivative.</p>
