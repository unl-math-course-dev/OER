<p>A recurring theme in our discussion of differential calculus has been the question “Given information about the derivative of an unknown function \(f\text{,}\) how much information can we obtain about \(f\) itself?” In <a knowl="./knowl/act-1-8-2.html" knowl-id="xref-act-1-8-2" alt="Activity 1.30 " title="Activity 1.30 ">Activity 1.30</a>, the graph of \(y = f'(x)\) was known (along with the value of \(f\) at a single point) and we endeavored to sketch a possible graph of \(f\) near the known point. In <a knowl="./knowl/Ex-f-from-f-prime.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex-f-from-f-prime" alt="Example 3.7 " title="Example 3.7 ">Example 3.7</a> — we investigated how the first derivative test enables us to use information about \(f'\) to determine where the original function \(f\) is increasing and decreasing, as well as where \(f\) has relative extreme values. If we know a formula or graph of \(f'\text{,}\) by computing \(f''\) we can find where the original function \(f\) is concave up and concave down. Thus, knowing \(f'\) and \(f''\) enables us to understand the shape of the graph of \(f\text{.}\)</p>
