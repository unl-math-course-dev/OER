<li><p>\(AV_{[1.5,2]} = \frac{s(2)-s(1.5)}{2-1.5} = -24\) ft/sec. We note that this average velocity is negative, and in fact is the opposite of the average velocity of 24 ft/sec on the interval \([0,0.5]\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(AV_{[1.499,1.5]} = -15.984\) and \(AV_{[1.5, 1.501]} = -16.016\text{,}\) it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at \(t = 1.5\) is approximately \(-16\) ft/sec. Similar computations show that at \(t = 2\text{,}\) it appears the instantaneous velocity is about \(-32\) ft/sec. Note that \(-16&gt;-32\text{,}\) so the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 1.5\) is greater because it is “less negative.” Asking which number is “greater” is different from asking which number is “more negative.”</p></li>
<li><p>When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that \((1,s(1))\) is the vertex of the parabola given by \(s(t)\text{.}\) At this point, the ball is neither rising nor falling. On intervals of the form \([a,1]\text{,}\) where \(a \lt 1\text{,}\) the average velocity of the ball is positive; on intervals of form \([1,b]\text{,}\) where \(b &gt; 1\text{,}\) the average velocity is positive. Hence we expect the instantaneous velocity of the ball at the moment \(t = 1\) to be zero.</p></li>
