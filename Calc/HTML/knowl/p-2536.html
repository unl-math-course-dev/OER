<p>Now that we know where \(f\) is increasing and decreasing as well as where \(f\) is concave up and concave down, along with the fact that \(f(0) = -0.5\text{,}\) we can sketch an approximate graph of \(y = f(x)\text{.}\) Note that we also know \(f\) has a horizontal tangent line at \(x = 1\) while being increasing on either side of \(x = 1\text{,}\) and earlier we established that \(f\) has a local minimum at \(x = -1\text{.}\) After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through \((0,-0.5)\text{,}\) we arrive at the graph shown at left below.</p>
