<p>A computer algebra system (CAS) is a computer program that is capable of executing symbolic mathematics. For example, if we ask a CAS to solve the equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) for the variable \(x\text{,}\) where \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) and \(c\) are arbitrary constants, the program will return \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\text{.}\) Research to develop the first CAS dates to the 1960s, and these programs became publicly available in the early 1990s. Two prominent examples are the programs <em class="emphasis">Maple</em> and <em class="emphasis">Mathematica</em>, which were among the first computer algebra systems to offer a graphical user interface. Today, <em class="emphasis">Maple</em> and <em class="emphasis">Mathematica</em> are exceptionally powerful professional software packages that can execute an amazing array of sophisticated mathematical computations. They are also very expensive, as each is a proprietary program. The CAS <em class="emphasis">SAGE</em> is an open-source, free alternative to <em class="emphasis">Maple</em> and <em class="emphasis">Mathematica</em>.</p>
