<p>Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c), but we state them explicitly to emphasize their individual importance. The definition says that a function is continuous at \(x = a\) provided that its limit as \(x \to a\) exists and equals its function value at \(x = a\text{.}\) If a function is continuous at every point in an interval \([a,b]\text{,}\) we say the function is “continuous on \([a,b]\text{.}\)” If a function is continuous at every point in its domain, we simply say the function is “continuous.” Thus, continuous functions are particularly nice: to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point, all we need to do is evaluate the function.</p>
