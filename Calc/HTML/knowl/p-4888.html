<p>We can't use \(u\)-substitution since there's not a function-derivative pair present (nor even a composite function). To show that integration by parts doesn't work is more complicated, but comes down to the fact that if we use the natural choice of \(u = x\) and \(dv = \tan(x) \, dx\text{,}\) to do so requires us to evaluate the integral \(\int \ln(\sec(x)) \, dx\text{,}\) which appears not to have an elementary antiderivative. If we try instead \(u = \tan(x)\) and \(dv = x \, dx\text{,}\) then we have to evaluate the integral \(\int x^2 \cdot \sec^2(x) \, dx\) which is more complicated than the integral we started with and would seem to send us back where we started if we attempt integration by parts.</p>
