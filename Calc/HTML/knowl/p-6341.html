<p>Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity, a differential equation naturally arises. In the following two problems, we see two such scenarios; for each, we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest. </p>

<li>
<p>Suppose you have a bank account in which money grows at an annual rate of 3%. </p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>If you have $10,000 in the account, at what rate is your money growing?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that you are also withdrawing money from the account at $1,000 per year. What is the rate of change in the amount of money in the account? What are the units on this rate of change?</p></li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Suppose that a water tank holds 100 gallons and that a salty solution, which contains 20 grams of salt in every gallon, enters the tank at 2 gallons per minute. </p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>How much salt enters the tank each minute?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that initially there are 300 grams of salt in the tank. How much salt is in each gallon at this point in time?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, suppose that evenly mixed solution is pumped out of the tank at the rate of 2 gallons per minute. How much salt leaves the tank each minute?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the total rate of change in the amount of salt in the tank?</p></li>
