<p>We approximate \(f\) by <em class="emphasis">sampling</em>, that is by partitioning the interval \([0,10]\) into uniform subintervals and recording the values of \(f\) at the endpoints. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Ineffective sampling can lead to several problems in reproducing the original signal. As an example, partition the interval \([0,10]\) into 8 equal length subintervals and create a list of points (the <em class="emphasis">sample</em>) using the endpoints of each subinterval. Plot your sample on graph of \(f\) in Figure <a knowl="./knowl/F-8-1-PA1.html" knowl-id="xref-F-8-1-PA1" alt="Figure 8.5 " title="Figure 8.5 ">Figure 8.5</a>. What can you say about the period of your sample as compared to the period of the original function?</p></li>
<li><p>The sampling rate is the number of samples of a signal taken per second. As the part (a) illustrates, sampling at too small a rate can cause serious problems with reproducing the original signal (this problem of inefficient sampling leading to an inaccurate approximation is called <em class="emphasis">aliasing</em>). There is an elegant theorem called the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem that says that human perception is limited, which allows that replacement of a continuous signal with a digital one without any perceived loss of information. This theorem also provides the <em class="emphasis">lowest</em> rate at which a signal can be sampled (called the Nyquist rate) without such a loss of information. The theorem states that we should sample at double the maximum desired frequency so that every cycle of the original signal will be sampled at at least two points. Recall that the frequency of a sinusoidal function is the reciprocal of the period. Identify the frequency of the function \(f\) and determine the number of partitions of the interval \([0,10]\) that give us the Nyquist rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Humans cannot typically pick up signals above 20 kHz. Explain why, then, that information on a compact disk is sampled at 44,100 Hz.</p></li>
