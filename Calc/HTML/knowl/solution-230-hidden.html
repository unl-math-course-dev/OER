<li><p>We can't use \(u\)-substitution since there's not a function-derivative pair present (nor even a composite function). To show that integration by parts doesn't work is more complicated, but comes down to the fact that if we use the natural choice of \(u = x\) and \(dv = \tan(x) \, dx\text{,}\) to do so requires us to evaluate the integral \(\int \ln(\sec(x)) \, dx\text{,}\) which appears not to have an elementary antiderivative. If we try instead \(u = \tan(x)\) and \(dv = x \, dx\text{,}\) then we have to evaluate the integral \(\int x^2 \cdot \sec^2(x) \, dx\) which is more complicated than the integral we started with and would seem to send us back where we started if we attempt integration by parts.</p></li>
<li>
<p>We use computational technology to generate the following estimates, which are reported to \(5\) decimal places of accuracy: </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>\(L_4 = 0.25892\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(R_4 = 0.64827\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(M_4 = 0.41550\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(T_4 = \frac{L_4 + R_4}{2} = 0.45360\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(S_8 = \frac{2M_4 + T_4}{3} = 0.42820\)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>From the values of these estimates or from the graph of \(f(x) = x\tan(x)\text{,}\) we can observe that \(f\) is always increasing and concave up on the interval. Thus, \(L_4\) and \(M_4\) are underestimates while \(R_4\) and \(M_4\) are overestimates.</p></li>
