<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Suppose we want to borrow $15,000 to buy a car. We take out a 5 year loan at 6.25%. What will our monthly payments be? How much in total will we have paid for this $15,000 car? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you charge your books for winter semester on your credit card. The total charge comes to $525. If your credit card has an interest rate of 18% and you pay $20 per month on the card, how long will it take before you pay off this debt? How much total interest will you pay?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Say you need to borrow $100,000 to buy a house. You have several options on the loan:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>30 years at 6.5%</p></li>
<li><p>25 years at 7.5%</p></li>
<li><p>15 years at 8.25%.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What are the monthly payments for each loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Which mortgage is ultimately the best deal (assuming you can afford the monthly payments)? In other words, for which loan do you pay the least amount of total interest?</p></li>
</ol>
