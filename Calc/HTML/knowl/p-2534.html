<p>Based on where \(f'(x)\) has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative, we can sketch an approximate graph of \(y = f''(x)\) in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function. From the given graph of \(y = f'(x)\text{,}\) we can see that \(f''(x) = 0\) at \(x \approx -0.35\) and at \(x = 1\text{,}\) and that between these points, \(f''(x)\) is negative because \(f'(x)\) is decreasing, while \(f''(x)\) is positive everywhere else since \(f'(x)\) is increasing everywhere else. A possible graph of \(y = f''(x)\) is shown at right in the following figure.</p>
