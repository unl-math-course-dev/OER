<p>Of the three conditions discussed in this section (having a limit at \(x = a\text{,}\) being continuous at \(x = a\text{,}\) and being differentiable at \(x = a\)), the strongest condition is being differentiable, and the next strongest is being continuous. In particular, if \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\text{,}\) then \(f\) is also continuous at \(x = a\text{,}\) and if \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\text{,}\) then \(f\) has a limit at \(x = a\text{.}\)</p>
