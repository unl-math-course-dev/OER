<p>Notice that the value of \(C\) is connected to the initial value of the velocity \(v(0)\text{,}\) since \(v(0) = 3+C\text{.}\) In other words, while the differential equation describes how the velocity changes as a function of the velocity itself, this is not enough information to determine the velocity uniquely: we also need to know the initial velocity. For this reason, differential equations will typically have infinitely many solutions, one corresponding to each initial value. We have seen this phenomenon before: given the velocity of a moving object \(v(t)\text{,}\) we cannot uniquely determine the object's position function unless we also know its initial position.</p>
