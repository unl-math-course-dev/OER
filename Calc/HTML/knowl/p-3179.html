<p>A baseball diamond is a square with sides \(90\) feet long. Suppose a baseball player is advancing from second to third base at the rate of \(24\) feet per second, and an umpire is standing on home plate. Let \(\theta\) be the angle between the third baseline and the line of sight from the umpire to the runner. How fast is \(\theta\) changing when the runner is \(30\) feet from third base?</p>
