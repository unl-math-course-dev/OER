<p>The assumption that its velocity is positive on a given interval guarantees that the movement of an object is always in a single direction, and hence ensures that its change in position is the same as the distance it travels. As we saw in <a knowl="./knowl/act-4-1-2.html" knowl-id="xref-act-4-1-2" alt="Activity 4.3 " title="Activity 4.3 ">Activity 4.3</a>, there are natural settings in which an object's velocity is negative, and we would like to understand this scenario as well.</p>
