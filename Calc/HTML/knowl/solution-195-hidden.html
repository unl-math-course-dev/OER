<li><p>By the Second FTC, \(A'(x) = f(x)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(A(1)= \int_2^1 f(t) \, dt = -\int_1^2 f(t) \, dt\text{,}\) it follows \(A(1) = -\frac{\pi}{4}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Note that \(A\) is increasing wherever \(f\) is positive, and \(A\) is CCU wherever \(f\) is increasing. Similar conclusions follow for \(A\) being decreasing and/or concave down. Moreover, \(A(2) = 0\text{,}\) \(A(3) = -0.5\text{,}\) \(A(4) = -1.5\text{,}\) \(A(5) = -2\text{,}\) \(A(6) = -2 + \frac{\pi}{4}\text{,}\) and \(A(7) = -2 + \frac{\pi}{2}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>In our current example, \(A\) is an antiderivative of \(f\) that satisfies \(A(0) = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4}\text{.}\) Our earlier work with \(F\) showed that \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(F\) that satisfied \(F(0) = -1\text{.}\) Since \(F\) and \(A\) are both antiderivatives of \(f\text{,}\) they differ by a constant, and that constant is \(-1 - (-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The Second FTC tells us that \(B' = f\) and \(C' = f\text{.}\) Thus, \(B\) and \(C\) are each antiderivatives of \(f\text{,}\) have the same shape as \(A\) and \(F\text{,}\) and each differ from \(A\) by just a constant. Observing that \(B(3) = 0\) and \(C(1) = 0\) enables us to easily sketch these shifted versions of \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
