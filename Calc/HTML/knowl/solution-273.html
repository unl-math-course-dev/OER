<li><p>\(P\) increases for \(1 \lt P \lt 3\) since \(\frac{dP}{dt} \gt 0\) for these \(P\)-values.</p></li>
<li><p>\(P\) decreases for \(P \lt 1\) and \(3 \lt P \lt 4\) since \(\frac{dP}{dt} \lt 0\) for these \(P\)-values.</p></li>
<li><p>If \(P(0) = 3\text{,}\) \(\frac{dP}{dt}\vert_{P=3} = 0\text{,}\) so \(P\) will not change at all with time since its derivative is \(0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If the initial population satisfies \(0\lt P(0)\lt 1\text{,}\) we expect that the population will decrease toward \(P = 0\) with \(P\) always being positive. Since \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is always negative for \(0\lt P \lt 1\text{,}\) \(P\) is always decreasing on this interval. The population can't drop below \(P = 0\) because at that value of \(P\text{,}\) \(\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\) and at that value the population wouldn't change.</p></li>
<li><p>If the initial population satisfies \(1\lt P(0)\lt 3\text{,}\) we expect that the population will increase toward \(P = 3\) with \(P\) always being between \(1\) and \(3\text{.}\) Since \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is always positive for \(1 \lt P \lt 3\text{,}\) \(P\) is always increasing on this interval. The population can't increase above \(P = 3\) because at that value of \(P\text{,}\) \(\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\) and at that value the population wouldn't change.</p></li>
<li><p>If the initial population satisfies \(3\lt P(0)\text{,}\) we expect that the population will decrease toward \(P = 3\) with \(P\) always being above \(3\text{.}\) Since \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is always negative for \(P \gt 3\text{,}\) \(P\) is always decreasing on this interval. The population can't drop below \(P = 3\) because at that value of \(P\text{,}\) \(\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\) and at that value the population wouldn't change.</p></li>
<li><p>It looks like there are two thresholds for the population: there's a minimum threshold of \(P = 1\text{,}\) since below that population, the population decreases to \(0\text{,}\) and there's a maximum threshold of \(P = 3\text{,}\) where if we are above the minimum but below the maximum, the population works to increase toward the maximum threshold, while if the population is above the maximum, its value will fall back toward it.</p></li>
