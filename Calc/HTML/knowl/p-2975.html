<li><p>We let \(r\) be the radius of the base of the cylindrical can and \(h\) be its height.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Volume is the area of the base times the height, so \(V = \pi r^2 h\text{.}\) Surface area is the area of the lids plus the area of the side, the latter of which is a rectangle with height \(h\) and width the perimeter of the base. Hence, \(S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h\text{.}\) Finally, the total cost is the cost of the lids plus the cost of the sides, which is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r h \cdot 0.015\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the volume is fixed at 16 cubic inches, we know that \(16 =  \pi r^2 h\text{.}\) Solving for \(h\text{,}\) \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\text{.}\) Substituting this expression for \(h\) in the formula for total cost, we now have that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r \left( \frac{16}{\pi r^2} \right) \cdot 0.015 = 0.054 \pi r^2 + 0.48 \frac{1}{r}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>With \(C(r) = 0.054 \pi r^2 + 0.48 \frac{1}{r}\text{,}\) we note that the only constraint on \(r\) is that \(r \gt 0\text{,}\) hence this is the domain on which we seek to minimize \(C\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noting that \(C'(r) = 0.108 \pi r - 0.48 \frac{1}{r^2}\text{,}\) we set \(C'(r) = 0\) and solve for \(r\) to find that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
0.108 \pi r = \frac{0.48}{r^2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so that \(r^3 = \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} \approx 1.41471\text{,}\) from which it follows that \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259\) is the only critical number of \(C\text{.}\) At this point, we can use either the first or second derivative test to justify that \(C\) has an absolute minimum at \(r = 1.12259\text{.}\) We choose to use the second derivative test; note that \(C''(r) = 0.108 \pi + 0.96 \frac{1}{r^3}\text{,}\) which is always positive for \(r \gt 0\text{,}\) hence \(C\) is always concave up on the relevant domain (\(r \gt 0\)), which makes \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259\) where the absolute minimum of \(C\) occurs. In addition, we note that since \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\text{,}\) the corresponding \(h\) value is \(h \approx 4.041337\text{,}\) and the overall minimum cost is \(C(1.12259) \approx 0.64137\text{.}\)</p>
