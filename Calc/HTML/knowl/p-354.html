<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-4-ffprime.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-4-ffprime" alt="Figure 1.35 " title="Figure 1.35 ">Figure 1.35</a>, on the left we show a plot of \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\) together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we've considered above. On the right, we show a plot of \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\) with emphasis on the heights of the derivative graph at the same selection of points. Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graphs: the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way: <em class="emphasis">the slope of the tangent line</em> at a point on the lefthand graph is the same as the <em class="emphasis">height</em> at the corresponding point on the righthand graph. That is, at each respective value of \(x\text{,}\) the slope of the tangent line to the original function is the same as the height of the derivative function. Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different: in the left graph, the vertical units are simply the output units of \(f\text{.}\) On the righthand graph of \(y = f'(x)\text{,}\) the units on the vertical axis are units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\text{.}\)</p>
