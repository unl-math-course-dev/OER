<li>The average velocity on \([0.5,1]\) is the slope of the line joining the points \((0.5,s(0.5))\) and \((1,s(1))\text{,}\) which is \(AV_{[0.5,1]} = \frac{1-1}{1-0.5} = 0\text{.}\) On \([1.5,2.5]\text{,}\) we similarly find \(AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = \frac{3-1}{2.5-1.5} = 2\text{,}\) and on \([0,5]\text{,}\) we have \(AV_{[0,5]} = \frac{5-0}{5-0} = 1\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity. If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number, that number represents the instantaneous velocity. For example, to estimate the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 2\text{,}\) we might consider average velocities on \([2,3]\text{,}\) \([2,2.5]\text{,}\) and \([2,2.25]\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If we draw the line through \((2,2)\) and \((2.1,s(2.1))\text{,}\) it looks like the line's slope is approximately 2.5: if we go over one grid-width, we appear to go up about 2.5. The slope of this line is clearly greater than the slope of the line through \((1.5, s(1.5))\) and \((2.5, s(2.5))\text{,}\) which is 2. Hence the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 2\) is greater than the average velocity on \([1.5,2.5]\text{.}\)</li>
