<p>Integration by parts is well suited to integrating the product of basic functions, allowing us to trade a given integrand for a new one where one function in the product is replaced by its derivative, and the other is replaced by its antiderivative. The goal in this trade of \(\int u \, dv\) for \(\int v \, du\) is that the new integral be simpler to evaluate than the original one. Sometimes it is necessary to apply integration by parts more than once in order to evaluate a given integral.</p>
