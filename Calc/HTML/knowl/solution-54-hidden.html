<li><p>Since \(f(2) = -1\) and \(f'(2) = 2\text{,}\) we have \(L(x) = -1 + 2(x-2)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Using our work in (a), \(f(2.07) \approx L(2.07) = -1 + 2(2.07-2) = -1 + 2\cdot 0.07 = -0.86\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>See the image in <a knowl="./knowl/part-1-8-Act2-soln-e.html" knowl-id="xref-part-1-8-Act2-soln-e" alt="Item e " title="Item e ">part e</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is increasing for \(x \lt 2\) because \(y = f'(x)\) is an increasing function on this interval. Similarly, for \(x &gt; 2\text{,}\) the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is decreasing. Right at \(x = 2\text{,}\) the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is neither increasing nor decreasing.</p></li>
<li>
<p>See the plot in the image below, which shows, at left, a possible graph of \(y = f(x)\) near \(x = 2\text{,}\) along with the tangent line \(y = L(x)\) through \((2, f(2))\text{.}\) Note that \(y = f(x)\) is concave up for \(x \lt 2\) since \(f'\) is increasing on that interval, and \(y = f(x)\) is concave down for \(x &gt; 2\) since \(f'\) is decreasing there. Hence \(y = f(x)\) changes from concave up to concave down right at \(x = 2\text{,}\) which is also the point near 2 where the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is steepest.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Because the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) lies above the graph  of \(f\) to the right of \(x = 2\text{,}\) our estimate of \(f(2.07)\) is too large — the local linearization overshoots the true value of \(f\) at this point.</p></li>
