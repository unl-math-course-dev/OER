<p>Viewing the tank as a solid of revolution, the tank is generated by the function \(R(x) = \sqrt{100-x^2}\text{,}\) and a typical slice has volume \(V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (\sqrt{100-x^2})^2 \Delta x\text{.}\) The force to move such a slice is its weight, \(F_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \pi (100-x^2) \Delta x\text{.}\) Each slice has to move \(x\) feet to clear the top of the tank, and then an additional 5 feet up to the truck, so the distance each slice moves is \(d_{\text{slice}} = x + 5\text{.}\) Finally, since the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet, and we wish to pump out the top 5 feet, \(x\) ranges from \(x=3\) (the top of the water) to \(x=8\) (the point at which there are 2 feet remaining in the tank). Hence, the total work done is</p>
