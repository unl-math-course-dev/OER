<p>From this study of position and velocity we have learned a great deal. We can use the derivative to find a function's instantaneous rate of change at any point in the domain, to find where the function is increasing or decreasing, where it is concave up or concave down, and to locate relative extremes. The vast majority of the problems and applications we have considered have involved the situation where a particular function is known and we seek information that relies on knowing the function's instantaneous rate of change. For all these tasks, we proceed from a function \(f\) to its derivative, \(f'\text{,}\) and use the meaning of the derivative to help us answer important questions.</p>
