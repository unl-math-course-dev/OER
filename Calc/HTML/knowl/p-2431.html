<p>To produce the first derivative sign chart in <a knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-signchart.html" knowl-id="xref-F-3-1-signchart" alt="Figure 3.8 " title="Figure 3.8 ">Figure 3.8</a> we identify the sign of each factor of \(f'(x)\) at one selected point in each interval. For instance, for \(x \lt -1\text{,}\) we could determine the sign of \(e^{-2x}\text{,}\) \((3-x)\text{,}\) and \((x+1)^2\) at the value \(x = -2\text{.}\) We note that both \(e^{-2x}\) and \((x+1)^2\) are positive regardless of the value of \(x\text{,}\) while \((3-x)\) is also positive at \(x = -2\text{.}\) Hence, each of the three terms in \(f'\) is positive, which we indicate by writing “\(+++\text{.}\)” Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for \(f'\text{,}\) which we denote by the “\(+\)” in the interval to the left of \(x = -1\text{.}\) And, since \(f'\) is positive on that interval, we know that \(f\) is increasing, so we write “INC” to represent the behavior of \(f\text{.}\) In a similar way, we find that \(f'\) is positive and \(f\) is increasing on \(-1 \lt x \lt 3\text{,}\) and \(f'\) is negative and \(f\) is decreasing for \(x \gt 3\text{.}\)</p>
