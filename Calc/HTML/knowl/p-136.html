<li><p>Taking into account the given information and our intuition about the diver's velocity, ketch a plot where the diver's height at time \(t\) is on the vertical axis. For instance, \(h(2.45) = 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>First, we see that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[2.45,7]} \approx \frac{-3.5-0}{7-2.45}=\frac{-3.5}{4.55}=-0.7692
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>m/sec. The average velocity is not the same on every time interval within \([2.45,7]\text{,}\) since the position function is not linear. Physically, we expect the water to make the diver's velocity change as she glides through the water.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the diver is going upward, her velocity is positive. When she is going downward, her velocity is negative. At the peak of her dive and when her feet touch the bottom of the pool, her velocity is zero because the velocity is changing sign there. Sketch a possible graph accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>It looks like when the position function is steep, the velocity function's value is farther away from zero, and that whenever the height/position function is rising/increasing, the velocity function has a positive value. Similarly, whenever the position function is decreasing, the velocity is negative.</p></li>
