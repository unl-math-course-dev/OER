<p>The variables in this problem are the volume \(V\) of water in the pool and the depth \(y\) of water in the pool (measured at the deepest point of the pool); each is implicitly a function of time, \(t\text{.}\) We are given that \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) is a constant \(800\) cubic feet per minute and want to find \(\frac{dh}{dt}\bigm|_{h=5}\text{.}\) To do this, we first need to relate \(V\) and \(h\text{.}\) The volume of the water in the pool at height \(h \lt 12\) is the volume of the triangular cross sectional area of height \(h\) (as shown in the figure below) times the width (25 feet) of the pool. The height of the triangular cross section is \(h\) and the length is distance of the dotted line indicated in the figure.</p>
