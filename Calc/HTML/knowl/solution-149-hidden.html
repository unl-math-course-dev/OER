<body><span class="solution"><p>We let the length of the cylindrical part of the tank be \(h\) with the radius of the cylinder given by \(r\text{.}\) It follows that the radius of the hemispherical ends of the tank is also \(r\text{.}\) We first identify formulas for both the volume and surface area of the tank by looking at the cylindrical and hemispherical pieces.</p>
<p>The cylindrical part of the tank has volume \(V_c = \pi r^2 h\text{,}\) and the surface area of its sides is \(A_c = 2\pi r h\) (which is the circumference of the cylinder's base times the cylinder's height -- think about how a cylinder unfurls to form a rectangle). The two hemispherical ends together constitute a full sphere, and the volume of a sphere is \(V_s = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\text{,}\) while the surface area of a sphere is \(A_s = 4 \pi r^2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The overall volume of the tank is therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = V_c + V_s = \pi r^2 h + \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and its total surface area is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A = A_c + A_s = 2\pi r h + 4 \pi r^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Moreover, taking into account the different costs of material for the cylindrical sides and hemispherical ends, we find that the total cost of the tank is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C = 2(2\pi r h) + 5(4 \pi r^2) = 4 \pi r h + 20 \pi r^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Our goal is to minimize the total cost of the tank given that we want it to hold 1000 cubic meters of volume. From this constraint, we have the equation \(1000 = \pi r^2 h + \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\text{,}\) which we can solve for \(h\) to get \(\pi r^2 h = 1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\text{,}\) so</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h = \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This allows us to now write cost as a function of the single variable \(r\) by substituting the expression for \(h\) into the earlier formula we found for cost. In particular,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C(r) = 4 \pi r \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2} + 20 \pi r^2 = 4 \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{r} + 20\pi r^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Simplifying further, we have found that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C(r) = \frac{4000}{r} - \frac{16}{3}\pi r^2 + 20 \pi r^2 = \frac{4000}{r} + \frac{44}{3}r^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Based on the physical constraints of the problem, we obviously will only consider values of \(r \gt 0\) and \(h \gt 0\text{.}\) Since \(h = \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2}\text{,}\) we must have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \lt 1000
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so \(r^3 \lt \frac{3}{4} \cdot 1000 = 750\text{,}\) and thus \(r \lt \sqrt[3]{750} \approx 9.086\text{.}\) We now work to minimize \(C(r)\) on the interval \(0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Taking the derivative of \(C\text{,}\) we find that \(C'(r) = -\frac{4000}{r^2} + \frac{88}{3}r\text{.}\) Setting \(C'(r) = 0\text{,}\) it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{4000}{r^2} = \frac{88}{3}r
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and thus</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
4000 \cdot \frac{3}{88} = r^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(r^3 = \frac{1500}{11}\text{,}\) so \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}} \approx 5.147\) is the only critical number of \(C\text{;}\) observe that it lies within the interval \(0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>If we plot the derivative function, \(y = C'(r)\text{,}\) on the interval \(0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}\text{,}\) we see that for \(0 \lt r \lt 5.147\text{,}\) \(C'(r) \lt 0\text{,}\) and for \(5.147 \lt r \lt 9.086\text{,}\) \(C'(r) \gt 0\text{,}\) which shows that \(C\) is decreasing before the critical number and increasing after the critical number, and hence \(C\) has a global minimum of \(C(\sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}}) \approx 1165.70\text{,}\) so $1165.70 is the minimum cost to build the desired tank under the given constraints.</p></span></body>
