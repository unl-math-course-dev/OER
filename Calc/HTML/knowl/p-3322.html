<p>The furthest north the biker was occurred at time \(t = 1\text{.}\) This occurs because it is the only time when the derivative of the biker's position function changes from positive to negative, and thus \(s\) has a local maximum. In addition, we can see this based on our discussion above of how far the biker traveled in each direction on the various time intervals, and that the biker was \(12\) miles north of the lake at \(t = 1\text{.}\)</p>
