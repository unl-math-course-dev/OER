<p>We start by constructing a careful diagram of the overall situation. Let \(x\) be the distance from the first pole to the second pole where the cable touches the ground, and let \(y\) be the length of the cable from the top of the first tower to the ground, and \(z\) the length of cable from the ground to the top of the second tower, as pictured in the following figure. Note that we have included the given heights of the towers and the distance between them.</p>
