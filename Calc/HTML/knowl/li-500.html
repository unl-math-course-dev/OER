<p>The value of a car is never negative. So we know that \(h(m) \geq 0\) for all \(m\text{.}\) A new car decreases in value very quickly at first, and as the car gets older with more mileage, its value will depreciate to near zero. So \(h\) is a decreasing function. Since the value of our car always decreases, it follows that \(h'(m) \lt 0\) for all \(m \gt 0\text{.}\) The fact that the depreciation slows as \(m\) increases implies that \(h'\) is an increasing (getting less negative) function. Since \(h'\) is increasing, it follows that \(h\) is bends upward; we will study this issue more in Section 1.6. So the graph of \(h\) might have the general shape of the graph of \(y = e^{-x}\) for positive values of \(x\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-1-5-units.html#li-500">in-context</a></span>
