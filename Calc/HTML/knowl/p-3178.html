<p>Placing the cross section on a coordinate system as in the figure, the hypotenuse of the triangle is the line connecting the points \((0,-15)\) and \((60, -3)\text{.}\) This line has slope \(\frac{12}{60} = 0.2\) and \(y\)-intercept \((0,-15)\text{.}\) So the equation of this line is \(y = 0.2x-15\text{.}\) It is the \(x\) coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the \(y\)-coordinate \(h-15\) that is the length of the triangle whose height is \(h\text{.}\) So the length \(l\) is \(l = \frac{(h-15)+15}{0.2} = 5h\text{.}\) Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height \(h\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = \left(\frac{1}{2}(h)(5h)\right)(25) = 62.5h^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Both \(V\) and \(h\) are functions of time. Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to  \(t\) gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = 62.5(2h) \frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{125h} \frac{dV}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>When the depth of water in the pool is \(5\) feet, then the depth is increasing at the rate</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{h = 5} = \frac{1}{125(5)} (800) = 1.28
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>feet per minute. Since \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is inversely proportional to \(h\text{,}\) the rate at which the depth of the water increases slows as \(h\) increases, so the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.</p>
