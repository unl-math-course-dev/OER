<p>For integration by parts to work, we normally need a choice of \(u\) that is straightforward to differentiate, and \(dv\) that is straightforward to antidifferentiate. Noting that the integrand can really only be written as the product of \(\frac{1}{x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\text{,}\) it appears that the most natural possible option is to let \(u = \sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(dv = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\text{,}\) since we can antidifferentiate \(\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\) Here, however, the approach stalls, because integration by parts requires us to evaluate \(\int v \, du\text{,}\) and that integral is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int \ln|x| \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( x + \sqrt{1+x^2} \right)^{-1/2} \cdot \left( 1 + x(1+x^2)^{-1/2} \right) \, dx
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which is far more complicated than the already-complicated integral we started with. From this it appears that integration by parts will not be productive.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-5-5-other-opt.html#li-3200">in-context</a></span>
