<li><p>Since \(e\) raised to any power is always positive (and thus never \(0\)), it follows that the only value that makes \(f'(x) = (x-1)e^{-x^2} = 0\) is \(x=1\text{.}\) This is confirmed by plotting \(f'\) where we only see the graph cross the \(x\)-axis at \(x=1\) (though we do see the graph approach the \(x\)-axis) as \(x\) increases or decreases without bound).</p></li>
<li><p>We know that \(f''(x) \gt 0\) wherever \(f'\) is increasing. From the graph of \(f'\text{,}\) we see that \(f'\) is increasing approximately on the interval \(-0.37 \lt x \lt 1.37\text{,}\) and thus \(f\) is concave up on this interval.</p></li>
<li><p>The tangent line approximation at \(a = 2\) is \(L(x) = f(2) + f'(2)(x-2) \approx 0.0182 + -0.05495(x-2)\text{.}\) Thus, \(f(1.88) \approx L(1.88) \approx 0.0182 + -0.05495(1.88-2) = 0.02479\text{.}\) Since \(f''(x) \lt 0\) at and around \(x = 2\text{,}\) \(f\) is concave down there, and therefore the tangent line lies above the curve. This makes our estimate larger than the true value of \(f(1.88)\text{.}\)</p></li>
