<p>(Draw a picture of the solid, based on revolving the region \(R\) about the \(y\)-axis.) We slice horizontally and thus the resulting cross sections are cylinders with thickness \(\triangle y\text{.}\) The radius of the disks changes as \(y\) passes through \(f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{8} = 1.125\text{,}\) so we need two different integrals to find the total volume. Since we are slicing horizontally, we will integrate with respect to \(y\text{,}\) so we  need to solve both of our equations for \(x\) as functions of \(y\text{.}\) Observe that \(y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2 \) implies \(2(y-1) = (x-2)^2\text{,}\) so \(x-2 = \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}\) and thus \(x = 2 \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}\text{,}\) and similarly \(y = \frac{1}{2}x^2\) implies \(x = \pm \sqrt{2y}\text{.}\) The portion of the curve defined by \(y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2\) that determines one of the boundaries is the left hand portion of the parabola, so \(x = 2 - \sqrt{2(y-1)}\text{,}\) while the portion of the curve \(y = \frac{1}{2}x^2\) that determines the other boundary is the right hand portion of the parabola, so \(x = \sqrt{2y}\text{.}\) These two curves define the radius of the disk (one for \(y \lt 1.125\text{,}\) the other for \(y \gt 1.125\)) and the lowest point on the region is \((0,0)\) while the highest is \((0,3)\text{.}\) So a sum of integrals that represents the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region \(R\) around the \(y\)-axis is</p>

\begin{equation*}
V = \int_{0}^{1.125} \pi \left(\sqrt{2y}\right)^2 \ dy + \int_{1.125}^3 \pi \left(2 - \sqrt{2(y-1)}\right)^2 \ dy \approx 7.06858347
