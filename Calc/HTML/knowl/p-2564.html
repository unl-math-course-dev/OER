<p>We note that \(h'\) is increasing everywhere, \(h\) is concave up everywhere. Since the graph of \(h'\) levels off for large values of \(|x|\text{,}\) the concavity of \(h\) is small when \(|x|\) is large. Also, the largest value of the slope of the tangent line to \(h'\) occurs when \(x=0\text{,}\) so \(h\) has its largest second dervitive when \(x=0\text{.}\) So \(h\) is almost linear as \(x\) decreases without bound, \(h\) has more bend as \(x\) approaches \(0\text{,}\) has its greatest bend at \(x=0\text{,}\) then the second derivative of \(h\) as \(x\) increases, ultimately having \(h\) become almost linear as \(x\) increases without bound.</p>
