<p>Noting that \(h'(x) = abe^{-bx}\text{,}\) we see that if we consider different values of \(b\text{,}\) the slope of the graph changes. If \(b\) is large and \(x\) is close to zero, \(h'(x) \approx ab\) (since \(e^0 = 1\)), so \(h'(x)\) is relatively large near \(x = 0\text{.}\) At the same time, for large \(b\text{,}\) \(e^{-bx}\) approaches zero quickly as \(x\) increases, so the curve's slope will quickly approach zero as \(x\) increases. If \(b\) is small, the graph is less steep near \(x = 0\) and its slope goes to zero less quickly as \(x\) increases.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-2-families.html#li-1873">in-context</a></span>
