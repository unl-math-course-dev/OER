<p>The linearization \(L\) of \(s\) at \(t=a\) is \(L(t) = s(a) + s'(a)(t-a)\text{.}\) With the information we have we can find the linearization of \(s\) at \(t=9\text{,}\) using the facts that \(s(9) = 4\) and \(s'(9) = -1.2\text{.}\) Thus, the linearization of \(s\) at \(t=9\) is \(L(t) = 4 - 1.2(t-9)\text{.}\) One use of the linearization is that for \(t\) close to \(9\text{,}\) \(L(t)\) can provide a good approximation to \(s(t)\text{.}\) So</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
s(9.34) \approx L(9.34) = 4-1.2(0.34) = 3.592\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Since \(s''(4) = 0.08\) is positive, we know that the graph of \(s\) is concave up at \(t=4\text{.}\) This means that the linearization of \(s\) at \(t=4\) lies below the graph of \(s\) and so \(L(9.34)\) is an underestimate to \(s(9.34)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Given that \(s'(4)\) is negative, the object is moving back toward its original position. The fact that \(s''(4)\) is positive means that the velocity of the object is increasing at \(t=4\text{.}\) This means that the object is actually slowing down as it moves toward toward its starting position at \(t=4\text{.}\)</p></li>
