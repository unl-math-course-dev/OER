<p>When a function is decreasing, its graph falls as \(x\) increases, and when a function is concave up, that means the graph of the function looks bowl-shaped. A graph of a decreasing, concave up function \(h\) on the interval \((-3,-1)\)is shown in the figure below. To be neither concave up or concave down, a graph has to be linear, so the graph of \(h\) in the following figure is a straight line on \((-1,1)\text{.}\) When a function is concave down, its graph looks like an upside down bowl. The function \(h\) in the figure is decreasing and concave down on the interval \((1,3)\text{.}\) Note that \(h\) is decreasing on the entire interval \((-3,3)\text{.}\)</p>
