<p>For example, suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. Since the balloon's volume and radius are related, by knowing how fast the volume is changing, we ought to be able to discover how fast the radius is changing. We are interested in questions such as: can we determine how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing at the moment the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?</p>
