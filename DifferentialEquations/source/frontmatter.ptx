    <p><em>Coordinated Differential Equations</em> is adapted from Thomas W. Judson's Open
      Educational Resource (OER) <em>The Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em>, originally
      published under a GNU Free Documentation License in 2018. This text was modified from the
      original to better fit the curriculum of MATH 221&#8211;Differential Equations at the
      University of Nebraska - Lincoln.</p>

    <p>While the spirit of the original text is preserved in this version, there are some structural
      differences. Perhaps most significantly, the treatment of second-order linear equations now
      immediately follows the introductory material in Chapter 1. In Judson's original, the second
      chapter is devoted to linear systems of equations; second-order equations are covered later in
      the text using techniques from linear systems. (In particular, the homogeneous second-order
      equation <m>ax'' + bx' + cx = 0</m> is solved by introducing an extra variable <m>u = x'</m>,
      which transforms the original equation into a two-by-two linear system.) In <em>Coordinated
      Differential Equations</em>, second-order linear equations are solved solely using the
      characteristic polynomial, with all linear algebra material deferred to later chapters.</p>

    <p>In order to give a richer picture of solutions to second-order linear equations, a new
      section in Chapter 1 is devoted entirely to complex numbers and their role in differential
      equations. This section includes basic information on complex arithmetic, as well as deeper
      material on Euler's formula (which is derived by solving the complex initial value problem <m>z'
      = iz</m>, <m>z(0) = 1</m>) and various trigonometric identities. The chapter on the Laplace
      Transform also occupies a more prominent place in <em>Coordinated Differential Equations</em>
      than in the original, immediately following Chapter 2 on second-order linear equations.</p>

    <p>While some exercises have been slighlty modified, and a few new ones added, the vast majority
      of the exercises in <em>Coordinated Differential Equations</em> are identical to those in <em>The
      Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em>. One caveat in this regard is with respect to
      exercises for which a computer algebra system may be useful or necessary: the original text
      contains many "built-in" SageMath modules, while the modified text does not. This is due to
      the fact that Sage is not commonly used in UNL mathematics courses, MATLAB being the more
      typical choice. As such, most references to Sage were removed during the developent of <em>Coordinated
      Differential Equations</em>. (Of course, interested students are still encouraged to explore
      other tools, including Sage, on their own!).</p>

    <p>Judson's original preface is included below for completeness. The present authors are heavily
      indebted to his work in developing the original text, which gives a clear, concise, and highly
      engaging introduction to ordinary differential equations.</p>

    <p>This text is intended for an undergraduate course in ordinary differential equations. <em>The
      Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em> began when the author was teaching the ordinary
      differential equations course at Harvard University. After arriving at Stephen F. Austin State
      University, the Harvard notes began to transform into the makings of a textbook. At the same
      time, the author was converting his abstract algebra book, <em>Abstract Algebra: Theory and
      Applications</em> (<url href="http://abstract.pugetsound.edu/index.html"
        visual="abstract.pugetsound.edu/index.html">http://abstract.pugetsound.edu/index.html</url>)
      from LaTeX into MathBook XML. With MathBook XML, which is now <pretext /> (<url
        href="https://pretextbook.org" visual="pretextbook.org">https://pretextbook.org</url>), one
      can produce HTML, PDF, EPUB, and even braille versions of a textbook while only having to
      maintain the <pretext /> source.</p>

    <p>There has been a strong trend during the past few decades to incorporate both modeling and
      technology into undergraduate differential equations courses. Since it is easy to insert
      computational cells inside an HTML version of the textbook with PreTeXt, there is now an
      opportunity to seemlessly embed technology into the textbook. Sage (<url
        href="http://sagemath.org" visual="sagemath.org">sagemath.org</url>), our technolgy of
      choice, is a free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics. Sage is ideal for
      assisting with a study of ordinary differential equations, since it cannot only be embedded as
      computational cells in a textbook, it can also be used on a computer, a local server, or on
      CoCalc (<url href="https://cocalc.com" visual="cocalc.com">https://cocalc.com</url>). The Sage
      code in <em>The Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em> has been tested for accuracy with
      the most recent version available at this time: Sage Version 9.2 (released 2020<ndash />10<ndash />
      24).</p>

    <p>There are additional exercises or projects at the end of many of the sections. Many of the
      projects come from SIMIODE (<url href="https://www.simiode.org" visual="www.simiode.org">
      https://www.simiode.org</url>). SIMIODE provides a rich environment for learning and teaching
      differential equations through modeling. SIMIODE was founded by Dr. Brian Winkel, Emeritus
      Professor of Mathematics, United States Military Academy, West Point NY USA in 2013. Some of
      the projects may require a basic knowledge of programming. All of these exercises and projects
      are more substantial in nature and allow the exploration of new results and theory.</p>

    <p>Another great source of problems and projects is the <em>CODEE Journal</em>, a peer-reviewed,
      open-access publication, distributed by the CODEE (Community of Ordinary Differential
      Equations Educators) and published by the Claremont Colleges Library (<url
        href="https://scholarship.claremont.edu/codee/" visual="scholarship.claremont.edu/codee/">
      https://scholarship.claremont.edu/codee/</url>). The goal of the <em>CODEE Journal</em> is to
      advance the teaching and learning of ODEs through the dissemination of materials that will be
      useful to both educators and education researchers.</p>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-Completing-the-Square">
        <title>Completing the Square</title>
        <p> First, let's focus on completing the square when the <m>x^2</m> coefficient is 1, i.e., a situation like <m>x^2+bx+c</m>. The steps are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Take the <m>x</m> coefficient, cut it in half, and square it, so <m>b</m> turns to <m>(b/2)^2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Add and subtract this new number <m>(b/2)^2</m> to the expression, after the <m>x</m> term but before the constant term, obtaining <m>x^2+bx+(b/2)^2-(b/2)^2+c</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The first three terms can be factored as <m>(x + \frac{b}{2})^2</m>. The constants at the end combine into a single term.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <example>
         <p> Complete the square on the expression <m>x^2 + 5x + 9</m>.
         </p>
         <p>
          We start by taking the <m>x</m> coefficient, <m>5</m>, and cut it in half and square it, obtaining <m>\frac{25}{4}</m>. We then add and subtract this term between the
          <m>x</m> term and the constant, obtaining
          <me>x^2 + 5x + \frac{25}{4} - \frac{25}{4} + 9</me>
          The first three terms factor; in this case we take <m>5</m> and cut it in half, and that tells us what to add to <m>x</m> that is squared. We obtain
          <me>x^2 + 5x + 9 = x^2 + 5x + \frac{25}{4} - \frac{25}{4} + 9 = (x + \frac52)^2 + \frac{11}{4}</me>
         </p>
        </example>
        <p>
          If the <m>x^2</m> coefficient is not equal to 1, we factor out the coefficient, complete the square of the part inside parenthesis as usual, and distribute the coefficient
          again.
        </p>
        <example>
          <p>
            Complete the square on the expression <m>4t^2 - 32t + 10</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <m>t^2</m> coefficient is <m>4</m>, so we factor it out and get <m>4(t^2 - 16t + \frac52)</m>; we then use the standard completing the square technique on
            <m>t^2 - 16t + \frac52</m>. The first step is adding and subtracting <m>(\frac{-16}{2})^2 = 64</m>; doing this and factoring gives
            <me>t^2 - 16t + \frac52 = t^2 - 16t + 64 - 64 + \frac52 = (t - 8)^2 - \frac{123}{2}</me>
            Then we multiply this by <m>4</m> to obtain
            <me>4t^2 - 32t + 10 = 4((t-8)^2 - \frac{123}{2}) = 4(t - 8)^2 - 246</me>
          </p>
        </example>

      <subsection xml:id="sec-solving-general-quadratic-equations">
        <title>Solving Quadratic Equations</title>
        <p>
          There are various ways to solve quadratic functions. Factoring works when the roots are rational numbers. Graphing works if an approximate answer suffices. Completing
          the square and the quadratic formula will always work. The previous section details how to complete the square; here, we review the quadratic formula.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one has a quadratic equation of the form <m>ax^2 + bx + c</m>, with <m>a \ne 0</m>, the solutions are given as
          <me>x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</me>
        </p>
        <example>
          <p>
            Solve the quadratic equation <m>x^2 - 4x = 2</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            Rearranging this to equal zero gives <m>x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0</m>, and we thus have <m>a = 1, b = -4, c = -2</m>. The solutions are
            <me>x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{24}}{2}=\frac{4\pm2\sqrt{6}}{2}=2\pm\sqrt{6}</me>
          </p>
        </example>
        <p>
          Sometimes there are no real solutions, but there are always complex solutions, as shown in the example below.
        </p>
        <example>
          <p>
            Solve the quadratic equation <m>2x^2-12x+27=0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have <m>a = 2, b = -12, c = 27</m>; plugging this in the quadratic formula gives
            <me>x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144-4(2)(27)}}{2(2)} = \frac{12\pm\sqrt{-72}}{4}</me>
            We can write
            <me>\sqrt{-72}=i\sqrt{72}=6\sqrt{2}i</me>
            So
            <me>x = \frac{12\pm6\sqrt{2}i}{4} = 3 \pm \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i</me>
          </p>
        </example>

        <title>Solving <m>2 \times 2</m> linear systems</title>
        <p>
          A <m>2 \times 2</m> linear system is a set of equations of the form
          <md>
            <mrow> a_{11}x + a_{12}y \amp = b_1 </mrow>
            <mrow> a_{21}x + a_{22}y \amp = b_2 </mrow>
          </md>
          where <m>a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{21}, a_{22}, b_1,</m> and <m>b_2</m> are constants, and <m>x, y</m> are variables to be solved for. A system can have one unique solution,
          no solutions, or infinitely many solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many methods to solve systems of equations, but the most common ones (which will be reviewed here) are substitution and elimination. The first example below
          shows how to use substitution, and the second shows how to use elimination.
        </p>
        <example>
          <p>
            Solve the following system of equations using substitution.
            <md>
              <mrow> 2x + 3y \amp = 5</mrow>
              <mrow> -4x + 2y \amp = 2</mrow>
            </md>
            We can use either equation to solve for either variable; let's use the first equation to solve for <m>y</m>. We get <m>y = \frac{5-2x}{3}</m>. We then plug this into
            the second equation to obtain
            <me>-4x + 2\cdot\frac{5-2x}{3} = 2</me>
            Simplifying the equation gives <m>\frac{-16}{3}x+\frac{10}{3} = 2</m>; solving this yields <m>x = \frac14</m>; plugging this into <m>y = \frac{5-2x}{3}</m> yields
            <m>y = \frac32</m>.
          </p>
        </example>
        <example>
          <p>
          Solve the following system of equations using elimination.
          <md>
            <mrow> 3x + 5y \amp = 2 </mrow>
            <mrow> 2x + 4y \amp = 3</mrow>
          </md>
          We want to multiply each equation by something and add them together so that one variable cancels with itself. The <m>x</m> coefficients are <m>3</m> and <m>2</m>; if we
          multiply the first equation by <m>-2</m> and the second by <m>3</m> we get a <m>6x</m> and a <m>-6x</m> which will cancel when added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing this, the first equation becomes <m>-2(3x + 5y = 2) \to -6x - 10y = -4</m> and the second equation becomes <m>3(2x + 4y = 3) \to 6x + 12y = 9</m>; adding these
          equations yields
          <me>-6x - 10y + 6x + 12y = -4 + 9</me>
          <me>2y = 5 \to y = \frac52</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we can plug this into the equation <m>3x + 5y = 2</m> to get <m>x = \frac{-7}{2}</m>.
        </p>
        </example>
        <p>
          Sometimes a system will have infinitely many solutions, or none at all. The following examples show what happens when you try to solve them.
        </p>
        <example>
          <p>
            Solve the system of equations
            <md>
              <mrow>x - 2y \amp = 2</mrow>
              <mrow>-2x + 4y \amp = 1 </mrow>
            </md>
            Using substiting, the first equation tells us that <m>x = 2 + 2y</m>, and plugging this into the second equation gives <m>-2(2 + 2y) + 4y = 1</m>, which simplifies
            to <m>-4 = 1</m>. This obvious falsehood means there are no solutions.
          </p>
        </example>
        <example>
          <p>
            Solve the system of equations
            <md>

            If we try to eliminate the <m>x</m> variable, we can multiply the first equation by <m>-3</m> and the second by <m>2</m>, giving <m>-6x - 12y = 18</m>
            and <m>6x + 12y = -18</m>; adding these together gives <m>0 = 0</m>. This tells us there are infinitely many solutions; to find them, we can take either
            equation and solve for one of the variables. The first one gives <m>x = -3-2y</m>, and this is the full set. (That is, to find a solution, you can let
            <m>y</m> be whatever you want, and then use <m>x = -3-2y</m> to solve for <m>x</m>.)

          We can also take partial derivatives of functions of multiple variables, like <m>3x^2 + 2y</m>. Below are two examples of this.
        </p>
        <example>
          <p>
            Compute <m>\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(-3x^2y^2 + \sin(2x - y))</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            The "<m>\frac{\partial}{\partial x}</m>" part means we are taking the partial derivative with respect to <m>x</m>, treating <m>y</m> as a constant. The derivative
            of <m>-3x^2</m> is <m>-6x</m>, so the first term becomes <m>-6xy^2</m>. Then the derivative of <m>\sin(2x - y)</m>, treating <m>x</m> as a variable and <m>y</m>
            as a constant, is <m>2\cos(2x-y)</m>. The final answer is <m>-6xy^2 + 2\cos(2x-y)</m>.
          </p>
        </example>
        <example>
          <p>
            Compute <m>\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(\frac{x+y}{y} - xy^4)</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            The "<m>\frac{\partial}{\partial y}</m>" part means we are taking the derivative with respect to <m>y</m>, treating <m>x</m> as a constant, as if it were "<m>2</m>" or
            "<m>\pi</m>". The quotient rule on the first part means we have <m>\frac{y(1)-(x+y)(1)}{y^2}</m>. Then since the derivative of <m>-y^4</m> is <m>-4y^3</m>, so the second
            term turns to <m>-4xy^3</m>. The final answer is <m>\frac{-x}{y^2} - 4xy^3</m>.
