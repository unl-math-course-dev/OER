    <p><em>Coordinated Differential Equations</em> is adapted from Thomas W. Judson's Open
      Educational Resource (OER) <em>The Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em>, originally
      published under a GNU Free Documentation License in 2018. This text was modified from the
      original to better fit the curriculum of MATH 221&#8211;Differential Equations at the
      University of Nebraska - Lincoln.</p>

    <p>While the spirit of the original text is preserved in this version, there are some structural
      differences. Perhaps most significantly, the treatment of second-order linear equations now
      immediately follows the introductory material in Chapter 1. In Judson's original, the second
      chapter is devoted to linear systems of equations; second-order equations are covered later in
      the text using techniques from linear systems. (In particular, the homogeneous second-order
      equation <m>ax'' + bx' + cx = 0</m> is solved by introducing an extra variable <m>u = x'</m>,
      which transforms the original equation into a two-by-two linear system.) In <em>Coordinated
      Differential Equations</em>, second-order linear equations are solved solely using the
      characteristic polynomial, with all linear algebra material deferred to later chapters.</p>

    <p>In order to give a richer picture of solutions to second-order linear equations, a new
      section in Chapter 1 is devoted entirely to complex numbers and their role in differential
      equations. This section includes basic information on complex arithmetic, as well as deeper
      material on Euler's formula (which is derived by solving the complex initial value problem <m>z'
      = iz</m>, <m>z(0) = 1</m>) and various trigonometric identities. The chapter on the Laplace
      Transform also occupies a more prominent place in <em>Coordinated Differential Equations</em>
      than in the original, immediately following Chapter 2 on second-order linear equations.</p>

    <p>While some exercises have been slighlty modified, and a few new ones added, the vast majority
      of the exercises in <em>Coordinated Differential Equations</em> are identical to those in <em>The
      Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em>. One caveat in this regard is with respect to
      exercises for which a computer algebra system may be useful or necessary: the original text
      contains many "built-in" SageMath modules, while the modified text does not. This is due to
      the fact that Sage is not commonly used in UNL mathematics courses, MATLAB being the more
      typical choice. As such, most references to Sage were removed during the developent of <em>Coordinated
      Differential Equations</em>. (Of course, interested students are still encouraged to explore
      other tools, including Sage, on their own!).</p>

    <p>Judson's original preface is included below for completeness. The present authors are heavily
      indebted to his work in developing the original text, which gives a clear, concise, and highly
      engaging introduction to ordinary differential equations.</p>

    <p>This text is intended for an undergraduate course in ordinary differential equations. <em>The
      Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em> began when the author was teaching the ordinary
      differential equations course at Harvard University. After arriving at Stephen F. Austin State
      University, the Harvard notes began to transform into the makings of a textbook. At the same
      time, the author was converting his abstract algebra book, <em>Abstract Algebra: Theory and
      Applications</em> (<url href="http://abstract.pugetsound.edu/index.html"
        visual="abstract.pugetsound.edu/index.html">http://abstract.pugetsound.edu/index.html</url>)
      from LaTeX into MathBook XML. With MathBook XML, which is now <pretext /> (<url
        href="https://pretextbook.org" visual="pretextbook.org">https://pretextbook.org</url>), one
      can produce HTML, PDF, EPUB, and even braille versions of a textbook while only having to
      maintain the <pretext /> source.</p>

    <p>There has been a strong trend during the past few decades to incorporate both modeling and
      technology into undergraduate differential equations courses. Since it is easy to insert
      computational cells inside an HTML version of the textbook with PreTeXt, there is now an
      opportunity to seemlessly embed technology into the textbook. Sage (<url
        href="http://sagemath.org" visual="sagemath.org">sagemath.org</url>), our technolgy of
      choice, is a free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics. Sage is ideal for
      assisting with a study of ordinary differential equations, since it cannot only be embedded as
      computational cells in a textbook, it can also be used on a computer, a local server, or on
      CoCalc (<url href="https://cocalc.com" visual="cocalc.com">https://cocalc.com</url>). The Sage
      code in <em>The Ordinary Differential Equations Project</em> has been tested for accuracy with
      the most recent version available at this time: Sage Version 9.2 (released 2020<ndash />10<ndash />
      24).</p>

    <p>There are additional exercises or projects at the end of many of the sections. Many of the
      projects come from SIMIODE (<url href="https://www.simiode.org" visual="www.simiode.org">
      https://www.simiode.org</url>). SIMIODE provides a rich environment for learning and teaching
      differential equations through modeling. SIMIODE was founded by Dr. Brian Winkel, Emeritus
      Professor of Mathematics, United States Military Academy, West Point NY USA in 2013. Some of
      the projects may require a basic knowledge of programming. All of these exercises and projects
      are more substantial in nature and allow the exploration of new results and theory.</p>

    <p>Another great source of problems and projects is the <em>CODEE Journal</em>, a peer-reviewed,
      open-access publication, distributed by the CODEE (Community of Ordinary Differential
      Equations Educators) and published by the Claremont Colleges Library (<url
        href="https://scholarship.claremont.edu/codee/" visual="scholarship.claremont.edu/codee/">
      https://scholarship.claremont.edu/codee/</url>). The goal of the <em>CODEE Journal</em> is to
      advance the teaching and learning of ODEs through the dissemination of materials that will be
      useful to both educators and education researchers.</p>
