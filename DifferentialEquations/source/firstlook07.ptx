    <introduction>
        <p>Many of the equations that we have examined have a <term>parameter</term><idx>parameter</idx>, which means that we actually have a family of differential equations. For example,
            <me>\frac{dx}{dt} = kx</me>
        has the growth rate parameter <m>k</m>. The logistic equation
            <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\left( 1 - \frac{P}{N} \right)</me>
        has two parameters, <m>k</m> and <m>N</m>. In this section we will investigate how the solutions of a differential equation vary as we change the value of a parameter.</p>

        <title>The Logistic Model with Harvesting Revisited</title>

        <p>Recall how we modeled logistic growth in a trout pond in <xref ref="firstlook03-example-harvesting" /> with the equation
            <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = P\left(1 - \frac{P}{200} \right).</me>
        If we allowed fishing in our pond at a rate of 32 fish per year, then the equation became
            <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = P\left(1 - \frac{P}{200} \right) - 32.</me>
        There are two equilibrium solutions for this equation, <m>P_1 = 160</m> (a sink) and <m>P_2 = 40</m> (a source). If the population of the pond falls below 40, then the fish will die out unless the pond is restocked or fishing is banned (<xref ref="firstlook07-figure-logistic-harvesting-sink-source" />).</p>

                    p += desolve_rk4(k*P*(1 - P/N) - H,P,ics=[0,200],ivar=t,output='plot',end_points=[0, 10],thickness=2, color='blue')

        </figure>

        <p>Now let us see what happens when we allow more fishing in our pond, say <m>H = 100</m>. Our differential equation now becomes
            <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = P\left(1 - \frac{P}{200} \right) - 100.</me>
        To determine the equilibrium solutions, we must solve
            <men xml:id="firstlook07-equation-over-harvesting">\frac{dP}{dt} = P\left(1 - \frac{P}{200} \right) - 100 = 0</men>
        for <m>P</m>. This last equation can be rewritten as <m>P^2 - 200P + 20000 = 0</m>. Thus, 
            <me>P = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{200^2 - 4 \cdot 20000}}{2} = 100 \pm \sqrt{-10000},</me>
        which means that equation <xref ref="firstlook07-equation-over-harvesting" /> has no real solutions and that we have no equilibrium solutions. Furthermore, <m>dP/dt \lt 0</m> for all values of <m>P</m>.  This means that no matter how many fish are in the pond initially, the trout population will eventually die out due to overfishing  (<xref ref="firstlook07-figure-over-harvesting" />).</p>

        <p>Finally, we will let <m>H = 50</m>. In this case, we must solve

        in order to determine any equilibrium solutions. We now obtain a single equilibrium solution at <m>P = 100</m>. In fact, <m>P = 100</m> will be a node.

        <p>To better understand what is happening, we will generalize our model. Suppose that a population with a limited carrying capacity <m>N</m> is modeled with the logistic equation
            <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\left(1 - \frac{P}{N}\right).</me>
        If we allow harvesting at a constant rate <m>H</m>, our model now becomes
            <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\left(1 - \frac{P}{N}\right) - H.</me>
        To analyze our model, we will first find the equilibrium solutions. If we will let
            <me>f_H(P) = kP\left(1 - \frac{P}{N}\right) - H,</me>
        each equilibrium solution must satisfy <m>f_H(P) = 0</m> or
            <me>-k P^2 + kNP - H  N = 0.</me>
        Therefore, our equilibrium solutions are given by
            <me>P = \frac{-kN \pm \sqrt{k^2N^2 - 4kHN}}{-2k} = \frac{N}{2} \pm  \sqrt{\frac{N^2}{4} - \frac{HN}{k}}.</me></p>

        <p>The explanation of how our model behaves lies in the discriminant,
            <me>\frac{N^2}{4} - \frac{HN}{k}.</me>
        If 
            <me>\frac{N^2}{4} - \frac{HN}{k} \lt 0</me>
        or, equivalently if <m>H \gt kN/4</m>, there are no equilibrium solutions and 
            <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = f_H(P) \lt 0</me>
        for all values of <m>P</m>. In particular, all solutions of <m>dP/dt = f_H(P)</m> tend towards negative infinity as <m>t \to \infty</m>. In this case, the population is doomed to extinction no matter how large the initial population is. Since negative populations do not make sense, we say that the population is extinct when <m>P = 0</m>.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, if <m>H \lt kN/4</m>, we have equilibrium solutions at
            <me>P_1 =\frac{N}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{N^2}{4} - \frac{HN}{k}}</me>
        and 
            <me>P_2 = \frac{N}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{N^2}{4} - \frac{HN}{k}}.</me>
        The first equilibrium solution, <m>P_1</m> is a sink, while the second, <m>P_2</m> is a source.</p>

        <p>Finally, if <m>H = kN/4</m>, then we will have exactly one equilibrium solution at <m>P = N/2</m>. Although <m>dP/dt \lt 0</m> for all <m>P \neq N/2</m>, we see that <m>P \to N/2</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m> for all initial values of <m>P</m> greater than <m>N/2</m>. For initial values of <m>P</m> less than <m>N/2</m>, solutions tend towards <m>- \infty</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>. Thus, the initial population of fish must be at least <m>kN/4</m>; otherwise, the fish will go extinct.</p>

        <p>In our example, we have a family of differential equations<mdash />one for each value of <m>H</m>,
            <men xml:id="firstlook07-equation-fishing">\frac{dP}{dt} = P\left( 1 - \frac{P}{200}\right) - H.</men>
        A small change in <m>H</m> can have a dramatic effect on how the solutions of the differential equation behave. Changing the value of <m>H</m> from <m>50</m> to <m>50.1</m> will doom the population of fish to extinction no matter what the initial population is. As we increase the value of <m>H</m>, the number of equilibrium solutions changes from two to one and then to none. This change occurs exactly at <m>H = 50</m>. We say that a <term>bifurcation</term><idx>bifurcation</idx> occurs at <m>H = 50</m> for equation <xref ref="firstlook07-equation-fishing" />.</p>

            <introduction>
                <p>The chukar partridge, or simply chukar, is a upland gamebird in the pheasant family. Originally native to Asia and ranging from the eastern Mediterranean to Himalayas, the chukar has been widely introduced as an upland game bird with populations now established in the United States, Canada, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand and Hawaii. One particularly good area for hunting chukar is the western Great Basin area of the U.S. (eastern Oregon and Washington and western Idaho).</p>

        <p>Bifurcations for a one-parameter family of differential equations <m>dx/dt = f_\lambda(x)</m> are, in fact, rare. Let us consider a bifurcation where a sink changes to a source as we vary the parameter <m>\lambda</m>. Suppose that for <m>\lambda = \lambda_0</m>, we have a sink at <m>x_0</m>. Then
            <me>\frac{dx}{dt} = f_{\lambda_0}(x_0) = 0.</me>
        Furthermore, the graph of <m>f_{\lambda_0}(x)</m> must be decreasing for <m>x</m> near <m>x_0</m>, since <m>f_{\lambda_0}(x)</m> must be postive for values of <m>x \lt x_0</m> and negative for values of <m>x \gt x_0</m>.  In other words, <m>f'_{\lambda_0}(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x</m> near <m>x_0</m>
        with <m>f'_{\lambda_0}(x_0) \lt 0</m>, then for all <m>\lambda_1</m> sufficiently close to <m>\lambda_0</m>, the differential equation
            <me>\frac{dx}{dt} = f_{\lambda_1}(x)</me>
        must have sink at a point <m>x = x_1</m> very close to <m>x_0</m>.  A similar situation holds if <m>x_0</m> is a source and <m>f'_{\lambda_0}(x_0) \gt 0</m>. Thus, bifurcations can only occur when <m>f_{\lambda_0}(x_0) = 0</m> and <m>f'_{\lambda_0}(x_0) = 0</m>.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Now consider the one-parameter family
                <me>\frac{dy}{dt}  = y^3 - \alpha y = y (y^2 - \alpha).</me>
            We will have an equilibrium solution at zero for all values of <m>\alpha</m> and two additional equilibrium solutions at <m>\pm \sqrt{\alpha}</m> for <m>\alpha \gt 0</m>.  This type of  bifurcation is a <term>pitch fork bifurcation</term><idx><h>bifurcation</h><h>pitch fork</h></idx> (<xref ref="firstlook07-figure-bifurcation-pitchfork" />).</p>

            If <m>g_\lambda(y) = y(y - 2)^2 + \lambda</m>, then <m>g'_\lambda(y) =  3y^2 - 8y + 4</m>. The roots of <m>g'_\lambda(y) = 0</m> are <m>y = 2</m> and <m>y = 2/3</m>. In order for <m>\lambda</m> to be a bifurcation value, we must have  <m>g_\lambda(2) = \lambda = 0</m> or
                <me>g_\lambda(2/3) = \frac{32}{27} + \lambda = 0 </me>
            Thus, equation<nbsp /><xref ref="firstlook07-equation-bifurcation-2" /> has two bifurcation values, <m>\lambda = -32/27</m> and <m>\lambda = 0</m>. The bifurcation diagram for this one-parameter family is given in <xref ref="firstlook07-figure-two-bifurcations" />.</p>
