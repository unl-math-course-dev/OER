        <introduction>
        	<p>Differential equations prove exceptional at modeling electrical circuits. In 
	        <xref ref="secondorder01-subsection-rlc-circuit" />, we modeled a simple RLC circuit, which is fundamental to larger circuit building. We found that circuits with the three of the most fundamental electrical objects, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, can be modeled by constant coefficient, linear, second order differential equations. Consider the circuit in <xref ref="secondorder01-figure-rlc-circuit" />. We found that the circuit can be modeled by 
	            <men xml:id="secondorder05-equation-rlc">L I'' + RI' + \frac{1}{C} I = E'(t),</men>
	        where <m>I(t)</m> is the current flowing through the circuit, <m>E(t)</m> is the impressed voltage, <m>R</m> is the resistance <m>R</m>, and <m>C</m> is the capacitance.  Of course we will also need to know <m>I(0)</m> and <m>I'(0)</m> if we wish to formulate an initial value problem.  Notice that <xref ref="secondorder05-equation-rlc" /> is very similar to the spring-mass model developed in <xref ref="systems01-subsection-spring-mass" />,

	        where <m>m</m> is the mass, <m>b</m> is the damping coefficient, and <m>k</m> is the spring constant (<xref ref="secondorder05-table-rlc-spring-mass" />).<fn>This project is adapted from Brian Winkel (2016), <q>4-060-S-CircuitTuner,</q> <url href="https://www.simiode.org/resources/2848" visual="www.simiode.org/resources/2848" />.</fn></p>

	    	<introduction>
		        <p>We now examine a circuit in which a current is present and does not have a driving <m>E(t)</m>, expecting things to dampen out, in this case current to run out. Let us consider an RLC circuit as depicted in <xref ref="secondorder01-figure-rlc-circuit" /> in which we have an initial current, <m>I(0) = 3.2</m> amps with a resistance of <m>R = 7</m> ohms, an inductance of <m>L = 1</m> henry, and a capacitance of <m>C = 0.1</m> farads. Since we have some current in the circuit already <m>I(0) = 3.2</m> at the start we shall not need an inducing <m>E(t)</m>, so <m>E(t) = 0</m>. Let us see what happens to the current in the circuit by solving the appropriate RLC circuit differential equation
		            <me>1 \cdot I'' + 7I' + \frac{1}{0.1} I = 0, \quad I(0) = 3.2, \quad I'(0) = 0.</me>
		        Of course, this initial value problem might be easier analyze in the form,
		            <men xml:id="secondorder05-equation-example-rlc">I'' + 7I' + 10 I = 0, \quad I(0) = 3.2, \quad I'(0) = 0.</men></p>
	        </introduction>


            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>Solve the RLC circuit differential equation <xref ref="secondorder05-equation-example-rlc" /> for <m>I(t)</m>.  If you use Sage to solve this equation, remember that <c>I</c> is the reserved symbol for <m>i</m>, the square root of <m>-1</m>.</p>

            </task>   

            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>Consider the values of <m>R</m> to be <m>0.007</m>, <m>0.07</m>, <m>0.7</m>, <m>7</m>, <m>70</m>, and then <m>700</m>, and solve <xref ref="secondorder05-equation-example-rlc" /> in each case, keeping all other values the same.  Plot the solutions for the current in the circuit over the time interval <m>[0, 25]</m> s with a vertical plot interval <m>[-3, 3]</m> in each case. Identify each plot with its associated <m>R</m> value and describe what is happening to the current, <m>I(t)</m>, in each corresponding circuit over time, <m>t</m>.</p>

	         	Here, <m>V_{\text{in}} = 1</m> for <m>E(t) = \sin(\omega t)</m> and has amplitude <m>1</m>, which is a function of <m>R</m>, <m>L</m>, <m>C</m>, and <m>\omega</m>. Gain is a measure of the response of the circuit to input voltage <m>E(t)</m>, which in this case is <m>E(t) = \sin(\omega t)</m>.</p>

	         	<p>Let us fix <m>R</m> at <m>1</m> ohm and <m>L</m> at <m>1</m> henry and see what gain is in this case as a function of <m>C</m> over a range of <m>\omega</m> values.

		        <p><xref ref="secondorder05-figure-gain" /> illustrates the power of differential equation modeling. For we can alter parameters in our equation and see the results in a physical (in this case electrical) system. Indeed, we see in this plot that for a capacitance of <m>C = 0.0005</m> farads if we have an input voltage with a frequency around <m>\omega = 45</m> (<m>44.7214</m> to be precise) then the gain is greatest. Optimization is a calculus problem and we merely have to take the derivative of gain with respect to <m>\omega</m> and find where it is <m>0</m>. All other frequencies give smaller gain for this particular capacitance. In fact, we can say that as we decrease our capacitance the optimal frequency; i.e., frequency which gives highest gain, decreases and we might want to look into this for a more exact relationship. We shall do that in <xref ref="secondorder05-task-tune-the-radio" />.</p>

		        <p>Put another way, we see that if our input voltage has a specific frequency, <m>\omega</m>, there is a unique capacitance, <m>C</m>, for this circuit that will maximize our gain. By changing <m>C</m> we can tune our circuit to maximize gain for a given input frequency, <m>\omega</m>. This is, in fact, how we tune a radio, for we change the capacitance of the radio's circuit so as to maximize the gain for the frequency (on our dial) that we wish to hear. So, the next time you try to find the station where Cousin Brucie is dedicating a Top Ten song from <q>Billie Bob</q> to <q>Sally May</q> know that a differential equation describes exactly what you are doing. How's that for cool?</p>

           <title>The Tacoma Narrows Bridge</title>

            <p>On July 1, 1940, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was completed and opened to traffic (<xref ref="secondorder05-figure-tacoma-narrows-bridge" />). From the first day of operation, the bridge experienced vertical oscillations of several feet. The bridge received the nickname <q>Galloping Gertie</q> for its wild behavior. On the morning of November 7, the bridge began undulating up and down with motions as large as three feet. Later, the bridge began to experience torsional oscillations as large as 23 degrees. The bridge finally came crashing down at 11:10 a.m. For a long time, the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was attributed to resonance. However, we shall soon see the the story is more complicated.</p>

            <p>There are many interesting stories connected with the first Tacoma Narrows bridge. One of the insurance policies had been written by a local travel agent who pocketed the premium and failed to report the $800,000 policy to his company. During sentencing at his trial, he pointed out that bridge officials had planned to cancel all policies in one more week after which his crime would have never been discovered. After the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge, the governor of the State of Washington announced, <q>We are going to build the exact same bridge, exactly as before.</q> Theodore Von Kármán, director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the board of inquiry into the collapse,<fn>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, managed by the California Institute of Technology for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration grew out of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory.</fn> sent a telegram to the governor stating, <q>If you build the exact same bridge exactly as before, it will fall into the exact same river exactly as before.</q></p>
        </introduction>

        <task>
            <title>The Design of the Narrows Bridge</title>

            <p>The Tacoma Narrows bridge is a suspension bridge like the Golden Gate bridge. The road bed of the suspension bridge was hung from vertical cables attached to other cables strung between the two towers. If we think of the cables as long springs, it is tempting to model the oscillations of the road bed with an harmonic oscillator, and one's first guess as to the reason for the collapse of the bridge would be resonance.</p>

            <p>However, the answer may not be so simple. If the collapse of the bridge was due to resonance, the forcing frequency of a forced harmonic oscillator must be close to its natural frequency, but the wind (the forcing) simply does not behave like this. One explanation might be the fact that cables are not true springs. They act more like rubber bands. Imagine a mass suspended by both a spring and a rubber band. The rubber band acts like a spring when it is stretched, but there is no restoring force if the oscillator is in a compressed position (<xref ref="secondorder05-figure-spring-rubber-band" />).<fn>For the arguments for and against resonance, consult the references at the end of this section.</fn></p>

                <caption>A spring-rubber band system</caption>
            </figure>

            <p>Suppose that <m>y(t)</m> is vertical displacement of the mass the spring-rubber band model (<xref ref="secondorder05-figure-spring-rubber-band" />), where the displacement is positive in the downward direction and negative in the upward direction. We will also assume that we have a damped system. If this is the case, we can model the motion of the mass with the differential equation
                <men xml:id="secondorder05-equation-spring-rubber-band-1">my'' = - b y' - k_1 y - k_2 y^+ + F(t),</men>
            where <m>y^+ = \max(y, 0)</m>.  Here,  <m>m</m> is the mass, <m>b</m> is the damping coefficient, <m>k_1</m> is the spring constant, and <m>F(t)</m> is the forcing term. The term <m>k_2 y^+</m> corresponds to the rubber band in our system and can be explained as follows:
                <me>y^+(t) =
                \begin{cases}
                y(t), &amp; \text{the rubber band is stretched}, \\
                0,    &amp; \text{the rubber band is slack or tight but not stretched}.
                \end{cases}</me>
            Thus, the rubber band acts as a spring with spring coefficient <m>k_2</m>, if the rubber band is stretched, but has no effect on the system if the rubber band is slack. Of course, the term <m>my''</m> is just an application of Newton's Second law of Motion.</p>

            <p>We can rewrite equation<nbsp /><xref ref="secondorder05-equation-spring-rubber-band-1" /> in the more familiar form
                <men xml:id="secondorder05-equation-spring-rubber-band-2">my'' + b y' + k_1 y +  k_2 y^+ = F(t),</men>
            Our first observation is that this equation is a nonlinear due to the <m>y^+</m> term. This may effect how sensitive the system is to initial conditions. A linear harmonic oscillator is not sensitive to initial conditions. For example, suppose we consider the harmonic oscillator
                <me>y'' + 2 y' + 2y = \sin t</me>
            and examine the behavior of the solutions for different initial conditions. In <xref ref="secondorder05-figure-tacoma-solutions-1" />, we give the solutions for <m>y(0) = 0</m> with <m>y'(0) = -4</m>, <m>y'(0) = 1</m>, and <m>y'(0) = 3</m>. Even though the transient part of the solution can differ a great deal depending on the initial conditions, all of the solutions eventually approach the steady-state solution.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Let us return to our spring-rubber band model and let us assume that <m>m = 1</m>. We can rewrite equation<nbsp /><xref ref="secondorder05-equation-spring-rubber-band-2" /> as a system of first-order equations,
                <md>
                    <mrow>y' &amp; = v</mrow>
                    <mrow>v' &amp; = - k_1 y  - k_2 y^+ - b v + F(t)</mrow>
                </md>
            or
                <md>
                    <mrow>x' &amp; = v</mrow>
                    <mrow>v' &amp; = - h(y) -  b v + F(t),</mrow>
                </md>
            where
                <me>h(y)
                =
                \begin{cases}
                k_1 y &amp; \text{if } y \lt 0 \\
                (k_1 + k_2) y &amp; \text{if } y \geq 0.
                \end{cases}</me>
            Let us assume that the forcing term is <m>F(t) = 10 + \lambda \sin \mu t</m>. If we keep <m>\lambda</m> small and assume that both <m>y(0)</m> and <m>y'(0)</m> are small, there will always be tension on the rubber band. Or in the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, there will always be tension on the cables of the suspension bridge. However, a large initial velocity such as a gust of wind on the bridge, might cause the cables to go slack.</p>

            <p>To see how this works in practice, we choose constants <m>\lambda = 0.1</m>, <m>\mu = 4</m>, <m>k_1 = 13</m>, <m>k_2 = 4</m>, and <m>b = 0.01</m>, the system becomes

                    <mrow>v' &amp; = - h(y) -  0.01v + 10 + 4 \sin 0.1 t</mrow>
                </md>
            where
                <me>h(y)
                =
                \begin{cases}
                13 x &amp; \text{if } x \lt 0 \\
                17 x &amp; \text{if } x \geq 0.
                \end{cases}</me>
            This is a nonautonomous (and nonlinear) system and can be very sensitive to initial conditions. If we find a numerical solution to this system with <m>y(0) = 0</m> and <m>v(0) = 4.764</m>, we obtain low amplitude solutions (<xref ref="secondorder05-figure-tacoma-solutions-2" />). However, we only have to change the initial velocity of the system slightly to <m>v(0) = 4.765</m> in order to obtain large amplitude solutions that do not die out over time.</p>

                    <li><m>\alpha y'</m> is the damping term. We assume that <m>\alpha</m> is small since suspension bridges are relatively flexible structures.</li>

                    <li><m>\beta y</m> is the force provided by the material of the bridge pulling the bridge back to <m>y = 0</m>.</li>

                    <li><m>\gamma y^+</m> is the force provided by the pull of the cables.</li>

                    <li><m>-gm</m> is the force provided by gravity.</li>

                    <li><m>F(t)</m> is the periodic force provided by the wind. Yes, wind does provide a periodic force. Just think of how a flag flutters in a wind.</li>
