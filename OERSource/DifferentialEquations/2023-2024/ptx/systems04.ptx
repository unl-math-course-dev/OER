    <introduction>

        <p>Mixing problems model how substances flow back and forth between two or more compartments. These problems often arise in applications<mdash />for example, we might want to model how greenhouse gases flow back and forth between different layers of the earth's atomosphere<xref ref="malcolm-1994" />, how chemicals move between tanks in a refinery or a brewery, or how pollutants move between a series of lakes or ponds. Systems of differential equations can prove very useful when it comes to modeling such situations.</p>

    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="systems04-subsection-partially-coupled">
        <title>Partially Coupled Systems</title>

        <p>We will use linear systems of differential equations such as
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = ax + by</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = cx + dy</mrow>
            </md>
        to illustrate how we can use systems of differential equations to model how substances flow back and forth between two or more compartments. Suppose that we have two tanks (<m>A</m> and <m>B</m>) between which a mixture of brine flows (<xref ref="systems04-figure-mixing-example"/>). Tank <m>A</m> contains 300 liters of water in which 100 kilograms of salt has been dissolved and Tank <m>B</m> contains 300 liters of pure water. Fresh water is pumped into Tank <m>A</m> at the rate of 500 liters per hour, and brine is pumped into Tank <m>B</m> from Tank <m>A</m> at the rate of 500 liters per hour. Brine is also drained at a rate 500 liters of brine per hour from Tank <m>B</m>. All brine mixtures are well-stirred.  If we let <m>x = x(t)</m> be the amount of salt in Tank <m>A</m> at time <m>t</m> and <m>y = y(t)</m> be the amount of salt in Tank <m>B</m> at time <m>t</m>, then we know that
            <md>
                <mrow>x(0) &amp; = 100</mrow>
                <mrow>y(0) &amp; = 0</mrow>
            </md>
        We know that the salt concentrations in the two tanks are <m>x/300</m> kilograms per liter and <m>y/300</m> kilograms per liter. Thus, we can describe the rate of change in each tank with a differential equation,
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = - 500 \cdot \frac{x}{300} = - \frac{5}{3} x,</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 500 \cdot \frac{x}{300} - 500 \cdot \frac{y}{300} = \frac{5}{3} x - \frac{5}{3} y.</mrow>
            </md></p>

        <p>We can now ask how we might solve the system of equations
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = - \frac{5}{3} x,</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = \frac{5}{3} x - \frac{5}{3} y.</mrow>
            </md>
        The task of solving the system
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; =f(x,y),</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = g(x,y),</mrow>
            </md>
        may be quite difficult or even impossible. However, we can find solutions in certain cases. For example, if we have a system of the form
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; =f(x),</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = g(y),</mrow>
            </md>
        then each equation is an autonomous first-order equation. To solve our system, we only need to solve two first-order equations. Such a system is said to be <term>decoupled</term><idx><h>system</h><h>decoupled</h></idx>. Generalizing slightly, we say that a <term>partially coupled system</term><idx><h>system</h><h>partially coupled</h></idx> is a system of the form
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; =f(x),</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = g(x, y).</mrow>
            </md>
        Since the first equation is an autonomous first-order equation in <m>x</m>, we can solve this equation separately, and substitute our solution into the second equation.</p>

        <p>Consider the system
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = x </mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = x + y.</mrow>
            </md>
        We can easily solve the first equation, <m>dx/dt = x</m>, to obtain <m>x = a e^t</m>. Using this information in the second equation, we have
            <me>\frac{dy}{dt}  - y = a e^t</me>
        which is a first-order linear equation. This equation has an integrating factor <m>\mu(t) = e^{-t}</m>, and 
            <me>\frac{d}{dt} (e^{-t} y) = \mu(t) \left(\frac{dy}{dt}  - y \right)= a e^t \mu(t) = a.</me>
        Therefore, the solution to our second equation is
            <me>y(t) = at e^t + be^t.</me></p>

        <p>Revisiting the mixing problem that we posed at the beginning of this section, we have the following initial value problem,
            <md>
                <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = - \frac{5}{3} x,</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = \frac{5}{3} x - \frac{5}{3} y.</mrow>
                <mrow>x(0) &amp; = 100,</mrow>
                <mrow>y(0) &amp; = 0.</mrow>
            </md>
        Solving <m>dx/dt = - (5/3) x</m> is easy.  We can quickly determine that <m>x(t) = c_1 e^{-5t/3}</m>. Applying the initial condition <m>x(0) = 100</m>, we can determine that <m>c_1 = 100</m> and <m>x(t) = 100 e^{-5t/3}</m>. Our second equation now becomes
            <me>\frac{dy}{dt}  = \frac{5}{3} x - \frac{5}{3} y = \frac{500}{3} e^{-5t/3} - \frac{5}{3} y.</me>
        This last equation is a first-order linear equation
            <me>\frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{5}{3} y = \frac{500}{3} e^{-5t/3}.</me>
        Multiplying both sides of this last equation by the integrating factor <m>\mu(t) = e^{5t/3}</m> yields
            <me>\frac{d}{dt} (e^{5t/3}y) = e^{5t/3}\frac{dy}{dt} + e^{5t/3}\frac{5}{3} y = \frac{500}{3}.</me>
        Integrating both sides of this last equation gives us
            <me>e^{5t/3}y = \frac{500}{3} t + c_2.</me>
        Using our initial condition <m>y(0) = 0</m>, we can determine that <m>c_2 = 0</m>. Thus,
            <me>y = \frac{500}{3} t e^{-5t/3}</me></p>


        <example xml:id="systems04-example-partially-coupled-system">
        	<p>Consider the partially coupled system

                    <mrow>y' &amp; = x + 3y</mrow>
                </md>
            Notice that we already have the tools to solve <m>x' = 2x</m>.  In fact, the solution is <m>x(t) = c_1 e^{2t}</m>.  We can use this information to solve the second equation, <m>y' = x + 3y</m>.  That is, if we use the fact that <m>x(t) = c_1 e^{2t}</m>, the second equation becomes
        		<me>y' = c_1 e^{2t} + 3y.</me>
        	We can rewrite this equation as 
        		<me>y' - 3y = c_1 e^{2t},</me>
        	which is a first-order linear equation.  If we multiply both sides of the equation by <m>\mu(t) = e^{-3t}</m>, we have
        		<me>\frac{d}{dt}\left( e^{-3t}y \right) = e^{-3t}y' - 3e^{-3t}y = c_1 e^{-t}.</me>
            Integrating, we have 
                <me>e^{-3t}y = - c_1 e^{-t} + c_2.</me>
            Solving for <m>y</m>, yields <m>y = - c_1 e^{2t} + c_2e^{3t}</m>.  Thus the solution to our system is

        is much more difficult, since we cannot use the same strategies that we used to solve partially-coupled systems. We will devote all of <xref ref="linear" /> to finding an answer.  However, we can use <em>Sage</em> to solve linear systems for the moment. The following is a <em>Sage</em> interact that will solve the initial value problem

        This is an example of an over-damped harmonic oscillator (<xref ref="systems04-figure-over-damped-oscillator" />). In other words, a spring-mass system that is modeled by this system of equations has so much damping that the mass will not oscillate.</p>

Fresh water is pumped into Tank <m>A</m> at the rate of 200 liters per hour, and brine is pumped into Tank <m>B</m> from Tank <m>A</m> at the rate of 200 liters per hour.
