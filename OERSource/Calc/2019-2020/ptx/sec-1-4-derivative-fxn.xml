      We now know that the instantaneous rate of change of a function <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x = a</m>,
      or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> at <m>x = a</m>,
      is given by the value <m>f'(a)</m>.
      In all of our examples so far,
      we have identified a particular value of <m>a</m> as our point of interest:
      <m>a = 1</m>, <m>a = 3</m>, etc.
      But it is not hard to imagine that we will often be interested many derivative values rather than just the derivative value at some point <m>a</m>.
      In this section,
      we explore how we can move from computing the derivative at a single point to computing a formula for <m>f'(a)</m> at any point <m>a</m>.
      Indeed, the process of <q>taking the derivative</q> of a function <m>f(x)</m>
      generates a new function,
      denoted by <m>f'(x)</m>.

  <subsection permid="Lgq">
    <title>How the derivative is itself a function</title>
    <p permid="aZi">
      In your work in <xref ref="PA-1-4">Example</xref> with <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>,
      you may have found several patterns.
      One comes from observing that <m>f'(0) = 4</m>,
      <m>f'(1) = 2</m>, <m>f'(2) = 0</m>, and <m>f'(3) = -2</m>.
      That sequence of values leads us naturally to conjecture that
      <m>f'(4) = -4</m> and <m>f'(5) = -6</m>.
      We also observe that the particular value of <m>a</m> has very little effect on the process of computing the value of the derivative through the limit definition.
      To see this more clearly, we compute <m>f'(a)</m>,
      where <m>a</m> represents a number to be named later.
      Following the now standard process of using the limit definition of the derivative,
      <md permid="cOv">
        <mrow>f'(a) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4(a + h) - (a + h)^2 - (4a-a^2)}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4a + 4h - a^2 - 2ha - h^2 - 4a+a^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4h - 2ha - h^2}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h(4 - 2a - h)}{h} =  \lim_{h \to 0} (4 - 2a - h)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Hgr">
      Here we observe that neither <m>4</m> nor <m>2a</m> depend on the value of <m>h</m>.
      So, as <m>h</m> tends to <m>0</m>, we have that <m>(4 - 2a - h)</m> approaches <m>(4 - 2a)</m>.
      Thus, <m>f'(a) = 4 - 2a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="nnA">
      This result is consistent with the specific values we found above:
      e.g., <m>f'(3) = 4 - 2(3) = -2</m>.
      Indeed, our work confirms that the value of <m>a</m> has almost no bearing on the process of computing the derivative.
      We note further that the letter being used is immaterial:
      whether we call it <m>a</m>,
      <m>x</m>, or anything else,
      the derivative at a given value is simply given by
      <q>4 minus 2 times the value.</q>
      We choose to use <m>x</m> for consistency with the original function given by <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      as well as for the purpose of graphing the derivative function.
      For the function <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>,
      it follows that <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="TuJ">
      Because the value of the derivative function is linked to the graph of the original function,
      it makes sense to look at both of these functions plotted on the same domain.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-4-ffprime" permid="QAd">
      <caption>The graphs of <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m> (at left) and <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m> (at right).  Slopes on the graph of <m>f</m> correspond to heights (<m>y</m>-values) on the graph of <m>f'</m>.</caption>

Is there another way of wording this?

    <p permid="zBS">
      The left half of <xref ref="F-1-4-ffprime">Figure</xref> above,
      shows a plot of
      <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m> together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we considered in <xref ref="PA-1-4">Example</xref>.
      The right half of the figure shows a plot of
      <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m> with emphasis on the heights of the derivative graph at the same selection of points.
      Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graphs:
      the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way:
      <em>the slope of the tangent line</em>
      at a point on the lefthand graph is the same as the <em>height</em>
      at the corresponding point on the righthand graph.
      That is, at each respective value of <m>x</m>,
      the slope of the tangent line to the original function is the same as the height of the derivative function.
      Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different:
      in the left graph,
      the vertical units are simply the output units of <m>f</m>.
      On the righthand graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      the units on the vertical axis are units of <m>f</m> per unit of <m>x</m>.

    <p permid="fJb">
      An excellent way to explore how the graph of <m>f(x)</m> generates the graph of <m>f'(x)</m> is through a java applet.

      For the latter four, use the limit definition.
      Pay careful attention to the function names and independent variables.
      It is important to be comfortable with using letters other than <m>f</m> and <m>x</m>.
      For example, given a function <m>p(z)</m>,
      we call its derivative <m>p'(z)</m>.

            The instantaneous rate of change of a linear function at a given point 
            is the same, regardless of the point chosen. This is because linear 
            functions have a constant slope, so any tangent line to a linear function
            coincides with the function itself (i.e., they are the same line). 
            In this case, 
            <m>f'(x) = 0</m> because the slope of the tangent line to the horizontal line given by

            The limit definition of the derivative,
            <m>f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m>,
            produces a value for each <m>x</m> at which the derivative is defined,
            and this leads to a new function <m>y = f'(x)</m>.
            It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function <m>f</m> and produces a new,
            related function
            <m>f'</m>.

            (as we did regularly in <xref ref="sec-1-3-derivative-pt">Section</xref>)
            and writing <m>f'(x)</m>.
            In either case,
            the variable is just a placeholder that is used to define the rule for the derivative function.

            Given the graph of a function <m>y = f(x)</m>,
            we can sketch an approximate graph of its derivative
            <m>y = f'(x)</m> by observing that <em>heights</em>
            on the derivative's graph correspond to <em>slopes</em>
            on the original function's graph.

            In <xref ref="act-1-4-1">Example</xref>,
            we encountered some functions that had sharp corners on their graphs such as the shifted absolute value function.
            At such points, the derivative fails to exist,
            and we say that <m>f</m> is not differentiable there.
            For now,
            it suffices to understand this as a consequence of the jump that must occur in the derivative function at a sharp corner on the graph of the original function.
