      In addition to learning how to differentiate a variety of basic functions,
      we have also been developing our ability to use rules to differentiate certain algebraic combinations of them.
    </p>

      <solution permid="uLi">
        <p permid="ION">
          Finding <m>s'</m> uses the sum and constant multiple rules,
          because <m>s(x) = 3g(x) - 5f(x)</m>.
          Determining <m>p'</m> requires the product rule,
          because <m>p(x) = g(x) \cdot f(x)</m>.
          To calculate <m>q'</m> we use the quotient rule,
          because <m>q(x) =\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="gme">
      There is one more natural way to combine basic functions algebraically,
      and that is by <em>composing</em> them.
      For instance, let's consider the function
      <me permid="LnU">
        C(x) = \sin(x^2)
      </me>,
      and observe that any input <m>x</m> passes through a
      <em>chain</em> of functions.
      In the process that defines the function <m>C(x)</m>,
      <m>x</m> is first squared, and then the sine of the result is taken.
      Using an arrow diagram,
      <me permid="rvd">
        x \longrightarrow x^2 \longrightarrow \sin(x^2)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Mtn">
      In terms of the elementary functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
      we observe that <m>x</m> is the input for the function <m>g</m>,
      and the result is used as the input for <m>f</m>.
      We write
      <me permid="XCm">
        C(x) = f(g(x)) = \sin(x^2)
      </me>
      and say that <m>C</m> is the <em>composition</em>
          <idx><h>composition</h></idx>
      of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
      We will refer to <m>g</m>,
      the function that is first applied to <m>x</m>,
      as the <em>inner</em> function, while <m>f</m>,
      the function that is applied to the result,
      is the <em>outer</em> function.
    </p>

    <p permid="sAw">
      Given a composite function
      <m>C(x) = f(g(x))</m> that is built from differentiable functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
      how do we compute <m>C'(x)</m> in terms of <m>f</m>,
      <m>g</m>, <m>f'</m>, and <m>g'</m>?
      In the same way that the rate of change of a product of two functions,
      <m>p(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)</m>,
      depends on the behavior of both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
      it makes sense intuitively that the rate of change of a composite function
      <m>C(x) = f(g(x))</m> will also depend on some combination of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> and their derivatives.
      The rule that describes how to compute <m>C'</m> in terms of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> and their derivatives is called the <em>chain rule</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="YHF">
      But before we can learn what the chain rule says and why it works,
      we first need to be comfortable decomposing composite functions so that we can correctly identify the inner and outer functions,
      as we did in the example above with <m>C(x) = \sin(x^2)</m>.
    </p>

<example xml:id="PA-2-5" permid="vLx">
  <p permid="PEo">
    For each function given below,
    identify its fundamental algebraic structure.
    In particular, is the given function a sum,
    product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?
    If the function is a composition of basic functions,
    state a formula for the inner function <m>g</m> and the outer function <m>f</m> so that the overall composite function can be written in the form <m>f(g(x))</m>.
    If the function is a sum, product,
    or quotient of basic functions,
    use the appropriate rule to determine its derivative.

    <title>The chain rule</title>
    <p permid="EOO">
      Often a composite function cannot be written in an alternate algebraic form.
      For instance, the function
      <m>C(x) = \sin(x^2)</m> cannot be expanded or otherwise rewritten,
      so it presents no alternate approaches to taking the derivative.
      But some composite functions can be expanded or simplified,
      and these provide a way to explore how the chain rule works.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-2-5-linear" permid="Zde">
      <statement>
        <p permid="jgK">
          Let <m>f(x) = -4x + 7</m> and <m>g(x) = 3x - 5</m>.

          How is <m>C'</m> related to <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> and their derivatives?

    <p permid="kVX">
      It may seem that
      <xref ref="ex-2-5-linear">Example</xref>
      is too elementary to illustrate how to differentiate a composite fuction.
      Linear functions are the simplest of all functions, and
      composing linear functions yields another linear function.
      While this example does not illustrate the full complexity of a composition of nonlinear functions,
      at the same time we remember that any differentiable function is
      <em>locally</em> linear,
      and thus any function with a derivative behaves like a line when viewed up close.
      The fact that the derivatives of the linear functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are multiplied to find the derivative of their composition turns out to be a key insight.
    </p>

    <p permid="Rdg">
      We now consider a composition involving a nonlinear function.

          Rewrite <m>C'</m> in the simplest form possible.

      <solution permid="GZA">
        <p permid="Bko">
          Using the double angle identity for the sine function, we write

            C(x) = \sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="hrx">
          Applying the product rule and simplifying, we find
          <me permid="PXN">
            C'(x) = 2\sin(x)(-\sin(x)) + \cos(x)(2\cos(x)) = 2(\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x))
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="NyG">
          Next, we recall that the double angle identity for the cosine,
          <me permid="weW">
            \cos(2x) = \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="tFP">
          Substituting this result into our expression for <m>C'(x)</m>,
          we now have that
          <me permid="cmf">
            C'(x) = 2 \cos(2x)
          </me>.
        </p>

    </example>

    <p permid="xkp">
      In <xref ref="ex-2-5-double-angle">Example</xref>,
      if we let <m>g(x) = 2x</m> and <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>,
      we observe that <m>C(x) = f(g(x))</m>.
      Now, <m>g'(x) = 2</m> and <m>f'(x) = \cos(x)</m>,
      so we can view the structure of <m>C'(x)</m> as
      <me permid="Ito">
        C'(x) = 2\cos(2x) = g'(x) f'(g(x))
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="dry">
      In this example, as in the example involving linear functions,
      we see that the derivative of the composite function <m>C(x) = f(g(x))</m>
      is found by multiplying the derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
      but with <m>f'</m> evaluated at <m>g(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="JyH">
      It makes sense intuitively that these two quantities are involved in the rate of change of a composite function:
      if we ask how fast <m>C</m> is changing at a given <m>x</m> value,
      it clearly matters how fast <m>g</m> is changing at <m>x</m>,
      as well as how fast <m>f</m> is changing at the value of <m>g(x)</m>.
      It turns out that this structure holds for all differentiable functions<fn>
      Like other differentiation rules,
      the Chain Rule can be proved formally using the limit definition of the derivative.

      The chain rule now joins the sum,
      constant multiple, product,
      and quotient rules in our collection of techniques for finding the derivative of a function through understanding its algebraic structure and the basic functions that constitute it.
      It takes practice to get comfortable applying multiple rules to differentiate a single function, but

              In (a) we are determining the instantaneous rate at which the volume changes as we increase the height of the water in the tank,
              while in (c) we are finding the instantaneous rate at which volume changes as we increase time.
              The first calculation is a direct one,
              while the second is more indirect,
              as it involves the composition of <m>V</m> with <m>h</m> as a function of time.
              In the latter case, both <m>h</m> and <m>V</m> are functions of time,
              which allows us to think not only of how <m>V</m> is changing as a function of <m>h</m>,
              but also as a function of <m>t</m>.
