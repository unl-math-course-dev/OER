          How does the method of trigonometric substitutions help us find antiderivatives of functions that may include expressions like <m> \sqrt{a^2-x^2}</m>, <m> a^2 + x^2 </m>, and <m> \sqrt{a^2 + x^2} </m> where <m> a </m> is any real number?

  <introduction permid="DDe">
    <p permid="IWR">
      We have learned two antidifferentiation techniques:
      <m>u</m>-substitution and integration by parts.
      The former is used to reverse the chain rule,
      while the latter is used to reverse the product rule.
      But we have seen that each works only in specialized circumstances.
      For example,
      while <m>\int xe^{x^2} \, dx</m> may be evaluated by <m>u</m>-substitution and
      <m>\int x e^x \, dx</m> by integration by parts,
      neither method provides a route to evaluate <m>\int e^{x^2} \, dx</m>.
      In fact, an elementary algebraic antiderivative for <m>e^{x^2}</m> does not exist.
      No antidifferentiation method will provide us with a simple algebraic formula for a function <m>F(x)</m> that satisfies <m>F'(x) = e^{x^2}</m>. 
    </p>

    <p permid="pea">
      In this section,
      our main goals are to identify some classes of functions that can be antidifferentiated,
      and to learn some methods to do so.
      We should also recognize that there are many functions for which an algebraic formula for an antiderivative does not exist,
      and appreciate the role that computing technology can play in finding antiderivatives of other complicated functions.

    For each of the indefinite integrals below,
    decide whether the integral can be evaluated using <m>u</m>-substitution,
    integration by parts, a combination of the two, or neither.


    For integrals for which your answer is affirmative,
    state the substitution(s) you would use.
    It is not necessary to actually evaluate any of the integrals completely,
    unless the integral can be evaluated immediately using a familiar basic antiderivative.

    <title>The Method of Partial Fractions</title>
    <idx><h>partial fractions</h></idx>

    <p permid="Vlj">
      The method of partial fractions is used to integrate some rational functions. A rational function is a function that can be written as a quotient of polynomials. The goal of partial fractions is to reverse the process of finding a common denominator, so this method works better when the denominator can be factored into smaller degree polynomials. It is an algebraic manipulation tool that can make integrals more manageable. The method of partial fractions will be demonstrated in the solutions of the next examples. A summary of the method of partial fractions and why it helps with evaluating integrals will follow these examples.

          <men xml:id="E-PF-1" permid="pNU">

          Notice that if this equation is going to hold, then the coefficients for <m> x </m> on each side of the equation need to match, and we need the constant terms on each side of the equation to match. This gives us the following system of equations:

          We find that <m> A=\frac{10}{3} </m> and <m> B=\frac{5}{3} </m>.

          If we factor the denominator of the integrand, we can see that <m> \frac{2x^2+5}{x^3-2x^2+x} = \frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2} </m>. Notice that the factor <m> (x-1)</m> shows up twice in the denominator. We call <m> (x-1)^2 </m> a repeated linear root. The repeated linear root slightly changes our partial fraction decomposition. <m> \frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2} </m> can be decomposed into the sum of fractions <m> \frac{A}{x}+ \frac{B}{x-1}+\frac{C}{(x-1)^2}</m>.

          The denominator of the integrand is already factored, and the quadratic polynomial <m> x^2 + 2x + 3 </m> cannot be factored anymore. We call this factor an irreducible quadratic factor. The irreducible quadratic factor slightly changes our partial fraction decomposition. <m> \frac{3x^2-1}{(x^2+2x+3)(x-2)} </m> can be decomposed into the sum of fractions <m> \frac{Ax+B}{x^2+2x+3}+ \frac{C}{x-2}</m>. We need the term <m> \frac{Ax+B}{x^2+2x+3} </m> to include all possibilities where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Suppose

          Multiplying both sides of this equation by the denominator of the left hand side, <m>(x^2+2x+3)(x-2) </m>, we find that

          We find that <m> A=2 </m>, <m> B=2 </m>, and <m> C=1 </m>. Thus, using <xref ref="E-PF-3"> Equation </xref>, we can rewrite the original integral as

      <p> 
        Before decomposing the integrand into partial fractions, we need to perform polynomial long division because the degree of the numerator, <m> 3</m>, is greater than the degree of the denominator, <m> 2</m>. We need to do this because partial fraction decompsition leads to a sum of rational functions where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.

        hence, we can change the original integral

      Notice that the denominator factors as <m> -x^2+3x-2= (x-1)(2-x) </m>, so we'll suppose the integrand decomposes as
      <me> \frac{7-3x}{(x-1)(2-x)}= \frac{A}{x-1}+ \frac{B}{2-x}</me>

      and we'll look for constants <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator of the left hand side, <m> (x-1)(2-x)</m>, we find that 
        <me> 7-3x = A(2-x) + B(x-1) </me>

        To find <m> A</m> and <m> B</m>, we will rearrange the right hand side of the equation so that similar terms are grouped.
        <md>
          <mrow> 7-3x&amp;=2A-Ax+Bx-B </mrow>
          <mrow> 7-3x&amp;=(B-A)x+(2A-B)</mrow>
        </md>
        To make sure the coefficients of <m> x</m> match on each side of the equation and that the constant terms are the same on each side of the equation, we obtain the following system of equations: 
        <me> -3=B-A \text{ and } 7=2A-B</me>

        We find that <m> A=4 </m> and <m> B=1 </m>. Thus, using <xref ref="E-PF-4"> Equation </xref>, we can rewrite the original integral as 
        <md>
          <mrow> \int \frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx

          <mrow> &amp;= \int 3x \, dx + \int \frac{4}{x-1} + \frac{1}{2-x} \, dx </mrow>
        </md> 
        These integrals can be evaluated by using the antidifferentiation rules from <xref ref="T-4-4-Act2_2"> Table </xref> and using appropriate substitutions, and hence we find that 
        <md> 
          <mrow> \int \frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx &amp;= \int 3x \, dx + \int \frac{4}{x-1}\, dx + \int \frac{1}{2-x} \, dx</mrow>

      These examples have demonstrated how to use the method of partial fraction decomposition in different situations including when the demoninator of a rational function is a product of distinct linear factors, when there is a repeated linear factor in the denominator, when there is an irreducible quadratic factor in the denominator, and when the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator.

      <title> Method of Partial Fraction Decomposition for a Rational Function <m> R(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} </m> </title>
      <p> 
        Note: This method works best on rational functions when <m> Q(x)</m> can be factored into linear and irreducible quadratic terms. 
        <ul> 
          <li>
            <p> If the degree of <m> P(x) </m> is greater than or equal to the degree <m> Q(x) </m>, then perform polynomial long division to calculate <m> \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}</m>, else move on to the next step. The result gives a new way to write <m>R(x)</m>. We know that <m> R(x)= S(x)+ \frac{P_2(x)}{Q(x)} </m> where <m> S(x) </m> is the quotient of the polynomial long division and <m> P_2 (x) </m> is the remainder of the polynomial long division. Now the degree of <m> P_2(x) </m> is less than the degree of <m> Q(x) </m>, so follow the remaining steps to decompose <m> \frac{P_2(x)}{Q(x)}</m> . </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> If the degree of <m> P(x) </m> is less than the degree of <m> Q(x)</m>, then factor <m> Q(x) </m> and add a partial fraction for the decomposition based on the following rules: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p> For each distinct linear factor <m> (x-c)</m> of <m> Q(x) </m>, add 
                    <me> \frac{A}{x-c}.</me>
                   </p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <p> For each repeated linear factor <m> (x-c)^n</m> of <m> Q(x)</m> where <m> n </m> is a positive whole number, add

                  <p> For each irreducible quadratic factor <m> t(x) </m> of <m> Q(x) </m>, add 
                  <me> \frac{Ax+B}{t(x)}. </me>
                  </p>

     The smaller blocks, or partial fraction terms, that <m> R(x) </m> is broken into often leads to more manageable antidifferentiation. For example if <m> A </m> and <m> k </m> are real numbers, then <m> \int \frac{A}{x-k} \, dx = A \ln |x-k| + C</m> by using the substitution <m> u=x-k </m>. We also know the antiderivative of other common partial fractions like <m> \int \frac{A}{x^2+1} \, dx= \arctan(x) + C </m>. 
     </p>
     
     <p> In many cases, partial fraction decomposition helps the process of finding algebraic antiderivatives; however, there are still some cases where we must find the antiderivative of rational functions like 
      <me> \int \frac{1}{x^2+4x+13} \, dx </me>
      for which we still need to develop different tools to find an algebraic antiderivative. The topic of <xref ref="Trig-Sub"> Trigonometric Substitutions </xref> will allow us to tackle antiderivatives of some ill-behaved functions.

    In the partial fraction section, we saw that this algebraic tool allowed us to break rational functions into manageable chunks, but we didn't yet have the right tool to handle indefinite integrals like <m>\int \frac{1}{x^2+4x+13} \, dx</m>. In <xref ref="E-TS-T4"> Example </xref>, we complete the square to put the integrand in the form <m> \frac{1}{(x+2)^2 + 9} </m>. Now, the integrand looks similar to the derivative of <m> \arctan(x+2) </m>, but we can see that this is not correct antiderivative since <m> \frac{d}{dx} [\arctan(x+2)]=\frac{1}{(x+2)^2+1}</m>. We'll introduce a new substitution style that introduces trigonometric functions so that we can leverage Pythagoren's Identity and a modified version of Pythagorean's Identity. The new tools we are introducing to find algebraic antiderivatives are the substitutions <m> x=\sin(\theta) </m> and <m>x=\tan(\theta)</m> and variations on these substitututions.

        Use the substitution <m>x=\sin(\theta) </m> where <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m> to find the general antiderivative 
        <me>\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\, dx.</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        When using the substitution <m> x=\sin(\theta) </m> where <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m>, we are regarding <m> x </m> as a function of <m> \theta </m>. The goal is to change the integrand to contain trigonometric functions so that Pythagorean's Identity can be used. To do this, the integral will be changed to be in terms of the variable <m> \theta</m>. With this in mind, both <m> x </m> and <m> dx </m> will need to be changed. Starting from <m> x=\sin(\theta) </m>, take the derivative with respect to <m> \theta </m> to find that 
        <me> \frac{dx}{d\theta}=\cos(\theta) .</me>
        In other words, <m> dx=\cos(\theta) \, d\theta </m>. Now, change the original integral to be in terms of the variable <m> \theta </m>: 
        <me> \int\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\, dx=\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta  </me>
        Use Pythagorean's Identity, <m>1-\sin^2(\theta)=\cos^2(\theta)</m> to simplify the denominator of the integrand:
        <me> \int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta = \int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}} \, d \theta.</me>
        Now we need to use the assumption that <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. In general, <m>\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=|\cos(\theta)|</m>, but <m>\cos(\theta)\geq 0</m> on the interval <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. Thus, <m> |\cos(\theta)|=\cos(\theta)</m> if <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m>. The denominator can now be further simplified, and the remaining steps lead to a familar integral: 
        <md>
          <mrow>\int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta \amp = \int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{|\cos(\theta)|} \, d\theta </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp =\int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} \, d\theta </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp =\int 1 \, d\theta </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp =\theta + C</mrow>
        </md>   
        While we have computed an antiderivative successfully, we aren't quite done yet because the answer is not written in terms of the original variable <m> x </m>. Rearrange the substitution equation <m>x=\sin(\theta) </m> to find that <m> \theta=\arcsin(x) </m> and use this to turn <m> \theta</m> back into a function of <m> x </m>. Therefore, 
        <me> \int\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx= \arcsin(x) + C </me>
      </p>
    </example> 
    From now on, we'll usually omit the explanation that <m> \sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=|\cos(\theta)|=\cos(\theta)</m> since we additionally assume that <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m> in order to force <m> \cos(\theta) \geq 0 </m>. It is still incredibly important so that the calculation of the antiderivative is seamless, but since we always assume that <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m> the same reasoning always applies.

          When we solve for <m> \theta </m> and replace it with a function of <m> x </m>, we obtain

To simplify this expression, we can look at a right triangle that has <m> \theta </m> as one of its angles and use some trigonometry. Since <m> \sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{3} </m>, we'll assume that the hypotenuse has length 3 and the side opposite the angle <m> \theta </m> has length <m> x </m>. The missing side length is found by using Pythagorean's Theorem. Then using this right triangle, we find that <m> \tan(\theta)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{9-x^2}} </m>.
          Therefore, 
          <me> \int \frac{9}{(9-x^2)^{3/2}} \, dx = \frac{x}{\sqrt{9-x^2}} + C </me>

    In the following example, we'll see why it is important that we restrict <m> \theta </m> to be in the interval <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} &lt; \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2} </m> when we use a tangent substitution.

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The expression <m> 25 + 9x^2 </m> can be rewritten as <m> 5^2+(3x)^2</m> so that it looks like <m> u^2+a^2</m>. The substitution <m> 3x=5\tan(\theta) </m> will allow us to use the modified Pythagorean Identity. Then <m> (3x)^2=25\tan^2(\theta)</m> and <m> dx=\frac{5}{3} \sec^2(\theta) d\theta </m>. The original integral can be transformed using this substitution: 
          <md> 
            <mrow>\int \frac{3x}{\sqrt{25+9x^2}} \, dx &amp;= \frac{5}{3}\int \frac{5\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25+25\tan^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta </mrow>
            <mrow> &amp;= \frac{25}{3}\int \frac{\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25(1+\tan^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta </mrow>
            <mrow> &amp;= \frac{25}{3}\int \frac{\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25\sec^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta </mrow>

          </md>
          We must be careful at this step when we simplify <m>\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}</m>. Because we chose <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} &lt; \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2} </m>, then <m>\sec^2(\theta) \geq 1 \geq 0 </m>. Notice that if we had picked a different interval for <m> \theta </m>, <m>\sec(\theta) </m> could be negative and then we would have to introduce an absolute value in order for the square root to be defined. Since we know <m> \sec^2(\theta) \geq 1\geq 0</m> on the interval of <m> \theta</m> we care about then <m> \sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}=\sec(\theta)</m>. Therefore, the integral simplifies further: 
          <md> 
            <mrow>\frac{25}{3}\int \frac{\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25}\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta &amp;= \frac{5}{3} \int \frac{\tan(\theta) \sec^2(\theta) }{\sec(\theta)} \, d \theta </mrow>

          </md>
          This answer can be simplified to a more recognizable form by using a right triangle with angle <m> \theta </m> and <m> \tan(\theta)=\frac{3x}{5} </m>, and finding <m> \sec(\theta) </m> by using the triangle.

    After using partial fraction decomposition, one of the partial fractions could have an irreducible quadratic in the denominator and a constant term in the numerator. For example, we might need to find the integral
    <me> \int \frac{1}{x^2+4x+13} \, dx.</me>
    We cannot use <m> u </m>-substitution since we would need a linear term in the numerator, and no other method of integration seems to work. If we complete the square in the denominator to recognize it as <m> u^2+a^2</m> where <m> u </m> is a variable term and <m> a </m> is a real number, then a tangent substitution becomes a very promising method of integration.

    <p>
      The substitution <m> u=a\tan(\theta) </m> where <m> u </m> is some function of <m> x </m>, <m> a </m> is a real number, and <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} &lt; \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2} </m> is often helpful when the integrand contains an expression of the form <m> a^2+u^2 </m>. When this substitution is used, then <m> u^2=a^2\tan^2(\theta)</m> and after factoring out <m> a^2 </m>, a modified Pythagorean's Identity <fn> <m>1+\tan^2(\theta)=\sec^2(\theta) </m></fn> can be used to simplify part of the integrand:

            Any polynomial function can be factored into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic terms,
