<introduction permid="BlB">
    <p permid="TYZ">
      In previous chapters,
      we have seen that a function's derivative tells us the rate at which the function is changing.
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus helped us determine the total change of a function over an interval from the function's rate of change.
      For instance,
      an object's velocity tells us the rate of change of that object's position.
      By integrating the velocity over a time interval,
      we can determine how much the position changes over that time interval.
      If we know where the object is at the beginning of that interval,
      we have enough information to predict where it will be at the end of the interval.
    </p>

    <p permid="Agi">
      In this chapter, we introduce the concept of
      <em>differential equations</em>.
      A differential equation is an equation that provides a description of a function's derivative,
      which means that it tells us the function's rate of change.
      Using this information,
      we would like to learn as much as possible about the function itself.
      Ideally we would like to have an algebraic description of the function.
      Unfortunately, this is too much to ask in some situations,
      but you are still be able to make accurate approximations.  However, for this chapter we will stick to cases in which we can find an explicit solution to a differential equation.

    <title>What is a differential equation?</title>
    <idx><h>differential equation</h></idx>

    <p permid="gnr">
      A differential equation is an equation that describes the derivative,
      or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us.
      For instance, the equation
      <me permid="cns">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x\sin(x^2)
      </me>
      describes the derivative of a
      function <m>y(x)</m> that is unknown to us.
    </p>
    
    
        <p permid="MuA">
      Many important examples of differential equations involve quantities
      that change in time; the independent variable in our discussion will
      frequently be time
      <m>t</m>.
      For example, the
      differential equation
      <me permid="IuB">
        \frac{ds}{dt} = 4t + 1
      </me>
      describes an objects position (given by <m>s(t)</m>) as a function of time.
    </p>
    
        <p permid="sBJ">
      If we know the velocity and the starting position of a moving object,
      we will be able to find its position at any later time.
    </p>
    
        <p permid="YIS">
      Because differential equations describe the derivative of a function,
      they give us information about how that function changes.
      Our goal will be to use this information to predict the value of the function in the future;
      in this way,
      differential equations are a type of "crystal ball."

  We can find the total change in the position of the object by integrating the equation for velocity over the interval <m>[0,4]</m>.  That is
  <me>\int_0^4 (4t+1)dt=\left.(2t^2+t)\right\vert_0^4=36</me>.  Therefore, the position changes by 36 feet over the interval <m>[0,4]</m>.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Simply knowing how much the position has changed on the interval <m>[0,4]</m> does not tell us where the object is.  In order to know where the object is located we must also know where the object started.
  </p>
  </li>
  
    <li>
  <p>
  We can find the total change in the position of the object by integrating the equation for velocity over the interval <m>[0,2]</m>.  That is
  <me>\int_0^2 (4t+1)dt=\left.(2t^2+t)\right\vert_0^2=10</me>.  Therefore, the position changes by 10 feet over the interval <m>[0,2]</m>.  Since we know that <m>s(0)=7</m>, we can say that <m>s(2)=7+10=17</m> ft.
  </p>
  </li>
  
      <li>
  <p>
  Note that <me>\int (4t+1)dt=2t^2+t+C</me>.  Since <m>s(0) = 7</m> ft, it is reasonable to use <m>s(0)</m> to "find" the constant <m>C</m>.  That is, we can say that <m>7=2(0)^2+0+C</m> which means <m>C=7</m>.  Therefore, the position of the object at anytime is given by the equation <m>s(t)=2t^2+t+7</m>.

    <title>Solving a differential equation</title>
    <idx><h>differential equation</h><h>solution</h></idx>

    <p permid="pHd">
      A differential equation describes the derivative,
      or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us.
      By a <em>solution</em> to a differential equation,
      we simply mean a function that satisfies this description.
    </p>

    <p permid="VOm">
      For instance, the first differential equation we looked at is
      <me permid="AQc">
        \frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1
      </me>,
      which describes an unknown function <m>s(t)</m>.
      We may check that <m>s(t) =
      2t^2+t</m> is a solution because it satisfies this description.
      Notice
      that <m>s(t) = 2t^2+t+4</m> is also a solution.
    </p>

    <p permid="BVv">
      If we have a candidate for a solution, it is straightforward to
      check whether it is a solution or not.
      Before we demonstrate, let's consider the same issue in a simpler context.
      Suppose we are given the equation
      <m>2x^2 - 2x = 2x+6</m> and asked whether <m>x=3</m> is a solution.
      To answer
      this question,
      we could rewrite the variable <m>x</m> in the equation with
      the symbol <m>\Box</m>:
      <me permid="gXl">
        2\Box^2 - 2\Box = 2\Box + 6
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="icE">
      To determine whether <m>x=3</m> is a solution,
      we can investigate the value of each side of the equation separately when the value <m>3</m> is placed in <m>\Box</m> and see if indeed the two resulting values are equal.
      Doing so, we observe that
      <me permid="Neu">
        2\Box^2 - 2\Box = 2\cdot3^2 - 2\cdot3 = 12
      </me>,
      and
      <me permid="tlD">
        2\Box + 6 = 2\cdot3 + 6 = 12
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OjN">
      Therefore, <m>x=3</m> is indeed a solution.
    </p>

    <p permid="uqW">
      We will do the same thing with differential equations.
      Consider
      the differential equation
      <md permid="ZsM">
        <mrow>\frac{dv}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5 - 0.5v, \ \text{or}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{d\Box}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5 - 0.5\Box</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ayf">
      Let's ask whether <m>v(t) = 3 - 2e^{-0.5t}</m> is a solution<fn>
      At this time,
      don't worry about why we chose this function.
      </fn>.
      Using this formula for <m>v</m>, observe first that
      <me permid="FzV">
        \frac{dv}{dt} =  \frac{d\Box}{dt}  = \frac{d}{dt}[3 - 2e^{-0.5t}] = -2e^{-0.5t} \cdot (-0.5) = e^{-0.5t}
      </me>
      and
      <me permid="lHe">
        1.5 - 0.5v = 1.5 - 0.5\Box= 1.5 - 0.5(3 - 2e^{-0.5t}) = 1.5 - 1.5 + e^{-0.5t} = e^{-0.5t}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="GFo">
      Since <m>\frac{dv}{dt}</m> and
      <m>1.5 - 0.5v</m> agree for all values of <m>t</m> when <m>v = 3-2e^{-0.5t}</m>,
      we have indeed found a solution to the differential equation.

      since <m>v(0) = 3+C</m>.
      In other words,
      while the differential equation describes how the velocity changes as a function of the velocity itself,
      this is not enough information to determine the velocity uniquely:
      we also need to know the initial velocity.
      For this reason,
      differential equations will typically have infinitely many solutions,
      one corresponding to each initial value.
      We have seen this phenomenon before:
      given the velocity of a moving object <m>v(t)</m>,
      we cannot uniquely determine the object's position function unless we also know its initial position.
    </p>

    <p permid="zaP">
      If we are given a differential equation and an initial value for the
      unknown function, we say that we have an
      <em>initial value problem.</em>
      For instance,
      <me permid="ROn">
        \frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v, \ v(0) = 0.5
      </me>
      is an initial value problem.
      In this problem, we know the value of
      <m>v</m> at one time and we know how <m>v</m> is changing.
      Consequently, there should
      be exactly one function <m>v</m> that satisfies the initial value problem.
    </p>

    <p permid="fhY">
      This demonstrates the following important general property of initial value problems.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="oXj">
      <p permid="Lph">
        Initial value problems that are
        <q>well behaved</q> have exactly one solution,
        which exists in some interval around the initial point.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="rwq">
      We won't worry about what <q>well behaved</q>
      means <mdash />it is a technical
      condition that will be satisfied by all the differential equations we
      consider.
