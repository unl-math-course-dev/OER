          If two quantities that are related,

          are both changing as implicit functions of time,
          how are their rates of change related?
          That is, how does the relationship between the values of the quantities affect the relationship between their respective derivatives with respect to time?

  <introduction permid="eZU">
    <p permid="IWr">
      In most of our applications of the derivative so far,
      we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable,
      say <m>y</m>, changes with respect to another, say <m>x</m>,
      leading us to compute and interpret <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We next consider situations where several variable quantities are related,
      but where each quantity is implicitly a function of time,
      which will be represented by the variable <m>t</m>.
      Through knowing how the quantities are related,
      we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related.

    <p permid="pdA">
      For example,
      suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second.
      Since the balloon's volume and radius are related,
      by knowing how fast the volume is changing,
      we ought to be able to discover how fast the radius is changing.
      We are interested in questions such as:
      can we determine how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing at the moment the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?

    A spherical balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second.

          All of these quantities are related to one another,

      Recognizing which geometric relationships are relevant in a given problem 
      is often the key to finding the function to optimize.
      For instance,
      although the problem in <xref ref="act-3-5-1">Example</xref>
      is about a conical tank,
      the most important fact is that there are two similar right triangles involved.
      In another setting,
      we might use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the legs of the triangle.
      But in the conical tank,
      the fact that the water fills the tank so that that the ratio of radius to depth is constant turns out to be the important relationship.
      In other situations where a changing angle is involved,
      trigonometric functions may provide the means to find relationships among various parts of the triangle.

              \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{h}{z} \frac{dh}{dt}

            Using this equation when <m>h = 3000</m> and
            <m>\frac{dh}{dt} = 600</m> led us to conclude that <m>\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{3}{5} \cdot 600 = 360 \ \text{feet/sec}</m>.
            If we instead use <m>h = 4000</m>,
            it follows that <m>z = 4000\sqrt{2}</m>, so that
            <me permid="nZQ">
              \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=4000} = \frac{4}{4\sqrt{2}} \cdot 600 \approx 424.26 \ \text{feet/sec}
            </me>.
            Indeed,
            <m>\frac{dz}{dt}</m> is an increasing function of <m>h</m>,
            provided that <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> is constant,
            because we can write <m>h^2 + 4000^2 = z^2</m>,
            so <m>z = \sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}</m>, making
            <me permid="UgZ">
              \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}} \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}} 600
            </me>.
            It is straightforward to verify that

    <p permid="yxm">
      In addition to finding instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time,
      we can often make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time.
      For instance,
      when a conical tank is filling with water at a constant rate,
      it seems obvious that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time.
      Note how carefully we must phrase the relationship:
      we mean to say that while the depth,
      <m>h</m>, of the water is increasing,
      its rate of change, <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>, is decreasing 
      (both as a function of <m>t</m> and as a function of <m>h</m>).
      We make this observation by solving the equation that relates the various rates for one particular rate,
      without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates.
      For instance,
      in the conical tank problem in <xref ref="act-3-5-1">Example</xref>,
      we established that
      <me permid="gtI">
        \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
      </me>,
      and hence
      <me permid="MAR">
        \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{16}{\pi h^2} \frac{dV}{dt}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="eEv">
      Provided that <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> is constant,
      it is immediately apparent that as <m>h</m> gets larger,
      <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> will get smaller
      but remain positive.
      Hence, the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.

    <solution permid="thz">
      <p permid="qmT">
        Using the given information, we construct the figure shown below.

      <sidebyside permid="jNN">

      </sidebyside>

      <p permid="Wuc">
        As pictured,
        we know that <m>5</m> is the vertical height from the pulley to the level of the bow of the boat,
        and we let <m>z</m> be the length of the rope from the pulley to the bow of the boat,
        and <m>x</m> the horizontal distance from the dock to the bow of the boat.
      </p>

      <p permid="CBl">
        We are given that the rope is being pulled in at <m>2</m> feet per second,
        and thus <m>\frac{dz}{dt} = -2</m> feet per second.
        Because we want to know how fast the boat is approaching the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet,
        we want to know <m>\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z=13}</m>.
        Thus, we need to relate the changing quantities <m>z</m> and <m>x</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="iIu">
        Because the rope, the post
        (vertically extended),
        and the horizontal distance from the bow of the boat to the post on the dock form a right triangle at all times,
        it follows that
        <me permid="phA">
          x^2 + 5^2 = z^2
        </me>.
        Having now related <m>z</m> and <m>x</m>,
        we differentiate this equation with respect to <m>t</m>.
        By the chain rule, we now see that
        <me permid="VoJ">
          2x \frac{dx}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}
        </me>.
        At the instant <m>z = 13</m>,
        <m>x^2 + 5^2 = 13^2</m>, and thus <m>x = 12</m>.
        Using all of the given information at the instant <m>z = 13</m> (including that <m>\frac{dz}{dt} = -2</m>),
        <me permid="BvS">
          2(12) \left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13} = 2(13)(-2)
        </me>.
        Solving for <m>\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13}</m>,
        <me permid="hDb">
          \left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13} = -\frac{13}{6}
        </me>
        feet per second.
        Thus the boat is approaching the dock at a rate of <m>\frac{13}{6} \approx 2.167</m> feet per second.

        </me>
        feet per minute.
        The depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution permid="FvR">
      <p permid="OPD">
        The variables in this problem are the volume <m>V</m> of water in the pool and the depth <m>y</m> of water in the pool (measured at the deepest point of the pool);
        each is implicitly a function of time, <m>t</m>.
        We are given that <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> is a constant <m>800</m> cubic feet per minute and want to find <m>\frac{dh}{dt}\bigm|_{h=5}</m>.
        To do this, we first need to relate <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.
        The volume of the water in the pool at height
        <m>h \lt 12</m> is the volume of the triangular cross sectional area of height <m>h</m>
        (as shown in the figure below)
        times the width (25 feet) of the pool.
        The height of the triangular cross section is <m>h</m> and the length is distance of the dotted line indicated in the figure.
      </p>

      <sidebyside width="65%" permid="PUW">
        <image source="images/3_5_Ez2Soln" />
      </sidebyside>

      <p permid="uWM">
        Placing the cross section on a coordinate system as in the figure,
        the hypotenuse of the triangle is the line connecting the points <m>(0,-15)</m> and <m>(60, -3)</m>.
        This line has slope <m>\frac{12}{60} = 0.2</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,-15)</m>.
        So the equation of this line is <m>y = 0.2x-15</m>.
        It is the <m>x</m> coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>h-15</m> that is the length of the triangle whose height is <m>h</m>.
        So the length <m>l</m> is <m>l = \frac{(h-15)+15}{0.2} = 5h</m>.
        Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height <m>h</m> is
        <me permid="tRt">
          V = \left(\frac{1}{2}(h)(5h)\right)(25) = 62.5h^2
        </me>.
        Both <m>V</m> and <m>h</m> are functions of time.
        Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to  <m>t</m> gives
        <me permid="ZYC">
          \frac{dV}{dt} = 62.5(2h) \frac{dh}{dt}
        </me>,
        so
        <me permid="GfL">
          \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{125h} \frac{dV}{dt}
        </me>.
        When the depth of water in the pool is <m>5</m> feet,
        then the depth is increasing at the rate
        <me permid="mmU">
          \left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{h = 5} = \frac{1}{125(5)} (800) = 1.28
        </me>
        feet per minute.
        Since <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> is inversely proportional to <m>h</m>,
        the rate at which the depth of the water increases slows as <m>h</m> increases,
        so the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.
