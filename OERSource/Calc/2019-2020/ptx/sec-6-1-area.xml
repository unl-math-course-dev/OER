  <introduction permid="wBv">
    <p permid="EPO">
      Early on in our work with the definite integral,
      we learned that for an object moving along an axis,
      the area under a non-negative velocity function <m>v</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> tells us the distance the object traveled on that time interval,
      and that area is given precisely by the definite integral <m>\int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m>.
      In general, for any nonnegative function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m> measures the area bounded by the curve and the <m>x</m>-axis between <m>x = a</m> and <m>x = b</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="kWX">
      Next,
      we will explore how definite integrals can be used to represent other physically important properties.
      In <xref ref="PA-6-1">Example</xref>,

    <title>The Area Between Two Curves</title>
    <idx><h>area</h></idx>

    <p permid="Reg">
      n <xref ref="PA-6-1">Example</xref>,
      we saw a natural way to think about the area between two curves:
      it is the area beneath the upper curve minus the area below the lower curve.
    </p>

    <example permid="EfU">
      <statement>
        <p permid="gne">
          Find the area bounded between the graphs of

        <p permid="WTs">
          In <xref ref="F-6-1-PA1revisited">Figure</xref>,
          we see that the graphs intersect at <m>(0,2)</m> and <m>(3,5)</m>.
          We can find these intersection points algebraically by solving the system of equations given by
          <m>y = x+2</m> and <m>y = (x-1)^2 + 1</m>:
          substituting <m>x+2</m> for <m>y</m> in the second equation yields <m>x+2 = (x-1)^2 + 1</m>,
          so <m>x+2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1</m>, and thus
          <me permid="DKv">
            x^2 - 3x = x(x-3) = 0
          </me>,
          from which it follows that <m>x = 0</m> or <m>x = 3</m>.
          Using <m>y = x+2</m>,
          we find the corresponding <m>y</m>-values of the intersection points.
        </p>

        <p permid="DaB">
          On the interval <m>[0,3]</m>,
          the area beneath <m>g</m> is
          <me permid="jRE">
            \int_0^3 (x+2) \, dx = \frac{21}{2}
          </me>,
          while the area under <m>f</m> on the same interval is
          <me permid="PYN">
            \int_0^3 [(x-1)^2 + 1] \, dx = 6
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="jhK">
          Thus, the area between the curves is
          <men xml:id="E-DiffOfInt" permid="wfW">
            A = \int_0^3 (x+2) \, dx -  \int_0^3 [(x-1)^2 + 1] \, dx = \frac{21}{2} - 6 = \frac{9}{2}
          </men>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="xlp">
      We can also think of the area this way:
      if we slice up the region between two curves into thin vertical rectangles
      (in the same spirit as we originally sliced the region between a single curve and the <m>x</m>-axis in <xref ref="sec-4-2-Riemann">Section</xref>),
      we see (as shown in <xref ref="F-6-1-PA1revisited2">Figure</xref>) that the height of a typical rectangle is given by the difference between the two functions,
      <m>g(x) - f(x)</m>,
      and its width is <m>\Delta x</m>.
      Thus the area of the rectangle is
      <me permid="cnf">
        A_{\text{rect} } = (g(x) - f(x)) \Delta x
      </me>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-6-1-PA1revisited2" permid="icr">
      <caption>The area bounded by the functions <m>f(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1</m> and <m>g(x) = x+2</m> on the interval <m>[0,3]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/6_1_PA1revisited2" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="dsy">
      The area between the two curves on <m>[0,3]</m> is thus approximated by the Riemann sum
      <me permid="Iuo">
        A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} (g(x_i) - f(x_i)) \Delta x
      </me>,
      and as we let <m>n \to \infty</m>,
      it follows that the area is given by the single definite integral
      <men xml:id="E-IntOfDiff" permid="oBx">
        A = \int_0^3 (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p permid="JzH">
      In many applications of the definite integral,
      we will find it helpful to think of a
      <q>representative slice</q>
      and use the definite integral to add these slices.
      Here, the integral sums the areas of thin rectangles.
    </p>

    <p permid="pGQ">
      Finally, it doesn't matter whether we think of the area between two curves as the difference between the area bounded by the individual curves
      (as in<nbsp /><xref ref="E-DiffOfInt" />)
      or as the limit of a Riemann sum of the areas of thin rectangles between the curves
      (as in<nbsp /><xref ref="E-IntOfDiff" />).
      These two results are the same,
      since the difference of two integrals is the integral of the difference:
      <me permid="UIG">
        \int_0^3 g(x) \, dx -  \int_0^3 f(x) \, dx = \int_0^3 (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="VNZ">
      Our work so far in this section illustrates the following general principle.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="LKt">
      <p permid="BVi">
        If two curves <m>y = g(x)</m> and
        <m>y = f(x)</m> intersect at <m>(a,g(a))</m> and <m>(b,g(b))</m>,
        and for all <m>x</m> such that
        <m>a \le x \le b</m>, <m>g(x) \ge f(x)</m>,
        then the area between the curves is <m>A = \int_a^b (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx</m>.

        Both of these quadratic functions pass through the points <m>(-1,0)</m> and <m>(1,0)</m>,

              The answer is yes.
              Let <m>AV</m> is the average value of a function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
              By the definition of average value,
              <me permid="ZiE">
                AV(b-a) = \int_a^b f(x) \ dx
              </me>,
              which can also be viewed as the area of the rectangle with base <m>(b-a)</m> and height <m>AV</m>.
              Now suppose that the area of the region above the graph of <m>f</m> and below the line <m>y=AV</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is <m>R_1</m> and the area of the region below the graph of <m>f</m> and above the line <m>y=AV</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is <m>R_2</m>.
              The figure below illustrates that the value of the definite integral is the area of the rectangle plus the area above the rectangle minus the area below the rectangle, or
              <me permid="FpN">
                \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = AV(b-a) + R_2 - R_1

              Having already established that <m>AV(b-a) = \int_a^b f(x) \ dx</m>,
              it follows that <m>R_2 - R_1 = 0</m>.
              So the area of the region that lies below
              <m>y = f(x)</m> and above <m>y = AV</m> is equal to the amount of area that lies below <m>y = AV</m> and above <m>y = f(x)</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>.
