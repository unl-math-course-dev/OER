    <p permid="Fdj">
      Much of mathematics centers on the notion of function.
      Indeed, throughout our study of calculus
      we are investigating the behavior of functions,
      with a particular emphasis on how fast the output of the function changes in response to changes in the input.
      Because each function represents a process,
      a natural question to ask is whether or not such a process can be reversed.
      That is, if we know the output that results from the function,
      can we (uniquely) determine the input that led to it?
      And
      if we know how fast a particular process is changing,
      can we determine how fast the inverse process is changing?

    <p permid="lks">
      One of the most important functions in all of mathematics is the natural exponential function <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.
      Its inverse, the natural logarithm
      <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m>, is similarly important.
      One of our goals in this section is to learn how to differentiate the logarithm function.

<solution>
  <p>
  <ol label="a.">
  <li>
    <p>
    To solve the equation <m>y=\frac59(x-32)</m> for <m>x</m>, we first multiply both 
    sides by <m>\frac95</m> and then add <m>32</m>:
    <md>
    <mrow>y=\mathstrut \amp \frac59(x-32)</mrow>
    <mrow>\frac95y=\mathstrut \amp x-32 </mrow>
    <mrow>\frac95y+32=\mathstrut \amp x</mrow>
    </md>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    From the initial equation <m>y=\frac59(x-32)</m> that relates a temperature of <m>x</m> degrees 
    Fahrenheit to the equivalent temperature <m>y</m> degrees Celsius, we have said that 
    <m>C(x)=y</m>. 
    Similarly, our work in part (a) rewrote that equation into the form <m>x=\frac95y+32</m> 
    demonstrating the same relation between a temperature of <m>x</m> degrees Fahrenheit and 
    <m>y</m> degrees Celsius. It should be the case, then, that <m>F(y)=x</m>. 
    Thus a formula for <m>F</m> is <me>F(y)=\frac95y+32</me>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    In part (b), we said that <m>C(x)=y</m> and <m>F(y)=x</m>. Based on this, it should be 
    the case that <me>p(x)=F(C(x))=F(y)=x</me>, but we'll take a closer look to double check. 
    Observe:
    <md>
    <mrow>p(x)=\mathstrut \amp F(C(x))</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \frac95C(x)+32</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \frac95\left(\frac59(x-32)\right)+32</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp (x-32)+32</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp x</mrow>
    </md>.
    To make sense of this, we notice that the function <m>p</m> takes a temperature <m>x</m>, 
    in degrees Fahrenheit, pushes it through the function <m>C</m> to convert it to <m>C(x)</m>
    degrees Celsius, and then pushes the result through the function <m>F</m> to convert it back into 
    degrees Fahrenheit. Since <m>F</m> and <m>C</m> are each just converting the units of a given 
    temperature, and the units of <m>F(C(x))</m> are the same as the units on <m>x</m>, it is 
    perfectly reasonable to end up with the equation <m>x=F(C(x))</m>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    The situation with <m>r(y)=C(F(y))</m> is analogous to that described in part (c). 
    In part (b), we said that <m>C(x)=y</m> and <m>F(y)=x</m>. Based on this, it should be 
    the case that <me>r(y)=C(F(y))=C(x)=y</me>, but we'll take a closer look to double check. 
    Observe:
    <md>
    <mrow>r(y)=\mathstrut \amp C(F(y))</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \frac59(F(y)-32)</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \frac59\left(\left(\frac95y+32\right)-32\right)</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \frac59\left(\frac95y\right)</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp y</mrow>
    </md>.
    To make sense of this, we notice that the function <m>r</m> takes a temperature <m>y</m>, 
    in degrees Celsius, pushes it through the function <m>F</m> to convert it to <m>F(y)</m>
    degrees Fahrenheit, and then pushes the result through the function <m>C</m> to convert it back into 
    degrees Celsius. Since <m>F</m> and <m>C</m> are each just converting the units of a given 
    temperature, and the units of <m>C(F(y))</m> are the same as the units on <m>y</m>, it is 
    perfectly reasonable to end up with the equation <m>y=C(F(y))</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    From this and part (c), we deduce that <m>C</m> and <m>F</m> are a pair of <em>inverse</em> functions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Since <m>C(x)=\frac59(x-32)</m>, we know that <m>C'(x)=\frac59</m> degrees Celsius per degree Fahrenheit.
    Likewise, since <m>F(y)=\frac95y+32</m>, we know that <m>F'(y)=\frac95</m> degrees
    Fahrenheit per degree Celsius. We note that these values are reciprocals of each other, 
    as might be expected from the units on each.

      The last fact reveals a special relationship between the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m>.
      If a point <m>(x,y)</m> lies on the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      then it is also true that <m>x = f^{-1}(y)</m>,
      which means that the point <m>(y,x)</m> lies on the graph of <m>f^{-1}</m>.
      This shows us that the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m> are the reflections of each other across the line <m>y = x</m>,
      because this reflection is precisely the geometric action that swaps the coordinates in an ordered pair.
      In <xref ref="F-2-6-Inverse-Plot">Figure</xref> below,
      we see this illustrated by the graphs of <m>y=f(x)</m> and <m>y=f^{-1}(x)</m>, where

      To close our review of important facts about inverses,
      we recall that the natural exponential function
      <m>f(x) = e^x</m> has an inverse function,
      namely the natural logarithm
      <m>f^{-1}(y) = \ln(y)</m>.
      Thus, writing <m>y = e^x</m> is interchangeable with <m>x = \ln(y)</m>,
      while also <m>\ln(e^x) = x</m> for every real number <m>x</m> and
      <m>e^{\ln(y)} = y</m> for every positive real number <m>y</m>.

    <title>The derivative of the natural logarithm function</title>
    <p permid="CiD">
      In what follows,
      we find a formula for the derivative of <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m>.
      To do so, we take advantage of the fact that we know the derivative of the natural exponential function,
      the inverse of <m>g</m>.
      In particular, we know that writing
      <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m> is equivalent to writing <m>e^{g(x)} = x</m>.
      Now we differentiate both sides of this equation and observe that
      <me permid="KwW">
        \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{g(x)}\right] = \frac{d}{dx}[x]

    </p>

    <p permid="ipM">
      The righthand side is simply <m>1</m>;
      by applying the chain rule to the left side, we find that

        e^{g(x)} g'(x) = 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OwV">
      Next we solve for <m>g'(x)</m> and get

      This rule for the natural logarithm function now joins our list of basic derivative rules.
      Note that this rule applies only to positive values of <m>x</m>,

    <p permid="mZF">
      Also notice that for the first time in our work,
      differentiating a basic function of a particular type has led to a function of a very different nature:
      the derivative of the natural logarithm is not another logarithm,
      nor even an exponential function,
      but rather a rational one.

    <p permid="TgO">
      Derivatives of logarithms may now be computed in concert with all of the rules known to date.

        the slope of the tangent to <m>y = e^x</m> is equal to the height of the curve at that point.
        For instance, at the point <m>A = (\ln(0.5), 0.5)</m>,
        the slope of the tangent line is <m>m_A = 0.5</m>,
        and at <m>B = (\ln(5), 5)</m>,
        the tangent line's slope is <m>m_B = 5</m>.
      </p>

      At the corresponding points <m>A'</m> and <m>B'</m> on the graph of the natural logarithm function
      (which come from reflecting <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> across the line <m>y = x</m>),
      we know that the slope of the tangent line is the reciprocal of the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the point (since <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}</m>).
      Thus, at <m>A' = (0.5, \ln(0.5))</m>,
      we have <m>m_{A'} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2</m>,
      and at <m>B' = (5, \ln(5))</m>,
      <m>m_{B'} = \frac{1}{5}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="LCp">
      In particular, we observe that
      <m>m_{A'} = \frac{1}{m_A}</m> and <m>m_{B'} = \frac{1}{m_B}</m>.
      This is not a coincidence,
      but in fact holds for any curve <m>y = f(x)</m> and its inverse,
      provided the inverse exists.
      This is due to the reflection across <m>y = x</m>.
      It changes the roles of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
      thus reversing the rise and run,
      so the slope of the inverse function at the reflected point is the reciprocal of the slope of the original function.

    <title>Inverse trigonometric functions and their derivatives</title>
    <p permid="rJy">
      Trigonometric functions are periodic,
      so they fail to be one-to-one,
      and thus do not have inverse functions.
      However, we can restrict the domain of each trigonometric function
      so that it is one-to-one on that domain.
    </p>

    <p permid="XQH">
      For instance,
      consider the sine function on the domain <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]</m>.
      Because no output of the sine function is repeated on this interval,
      the function is one-to-one and thus has an inverse.
      Thus, the function <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> with domain 
      <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]</m> and codomain <m>[-1,1]</m>
      has an inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m> such that
      <me permid="iZG">
        f^{-1} : [-1,1] \to [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]
      </me>.

    <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%" valign="top" permid="Ymg">
      <p permid="gAz">
        We call <m>f^{-1}</m> the <em>arcsine</em>
            <idx><h>arcsine</h></idx>
        (or inverse sine) function and write <m>f^{-1}(y) = \arcsin(y)</m>.
        It is especially important to remember that
        <me permid="PgP">
          y = \sin(x) \ \ \text{and}  \ \ x = \arcsin(y)

        <m>\frac{\pi}{6}</m> is the angle whose sine is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>,
        which is equivalent to writing <m>\sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2}</m>.

    <p permid="DXQ">
      Next, we determine the derivative of the arcsine function.
      Letting <m>h(x) = \arcsin(x)</m>,
      our goal is to find <m>h'(x)</m>.
      Since <m>h(x)</m> is the angle whose sine is <m>x</m>,
      it is equivalent to write
      <me permid="vnY">
        \sin(h(x)) = x

      The righthand side is simply <m>1</m>,

    <title>The link between the derivative of a function and the derivative of its inverse</title>
    <p permid="Bdk">
      Earlier, we saw in <xref ref="F-2-6-Log-Exp">Figure</xref> 
      an interesting relationship between the slopes of tangent lines to the natural exponential and natural logarithm functions at points reflected across the line <m>y = x</m>.
      In particular, we observed that at the point 
      <m>(\ln(2), 2)</m> on the graph of <m>f(x) = e^x</m>,
      the slope of the tangent line is <m>f'(\ln(2)) = 2</m>,
      while at the corresponding point
      <m>(2, \ln(2))</m> on the graph of <m>f^{-1}(x) = \ln(x)</m>,
      the slope of the tangent line is <m>(f^{-1})'(2) = \frac{1}{2}</m>,
      which is the reciprocal of <m>f'(\ln(2))</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="hkt">
      That the two corresponding tangent lines have reciprocal slopes is not a coincidence.
      If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable inverse functions, then
      <m>y = f(x)</m> if and only if <m>x = g(y)</m>,
      and thus <m>f(g(x)) = x</m> for every <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f^{-1}</m>.
      Differentiating both sides of this equation, we have
      <me permid="gfa">
        \frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = \frac{d}{dx} [x]
      </me>,
      and by the chain rule,
      <me permid="Mmj">
        f'(g(x)) g'(x) = 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="NrC">
      Solving for <m>g'(x)</m>, we have <m>g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}</m>.
      Here we see that the slope of the tangent line to the inverse function <m>g</m> at the point
      <m>(x,g(x))</m> is precisely the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to the original function <m>f</m> at the point <m>(g(x),f(g(x))) = (g(x),x)</m>.

      <m>y = f(x)</m> shown above in <xref ref="F-2-6-Gen-Inv">Figure</xref>
      along with its inverse <m>y = g(x)</m>.
      Given a point <m>(a,b)</m> that lies on the graph of <m>f</m>,
      we know that <m>(b,a)</m> lies on the graph of <m>g</m>
      because <m>f(a) = b</m> and <m>g(b) = a</m>.
      Applying the rule that
      <m>g'(x) = 1/f'(g(x))</m> to the value <m>x = b</m> yields the equation
      <me permid="sts">
        g'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(g(b))} = \frac{1}{f'(a)}
      </me>,
      which is precisely what we see in the figure:
      the slope of the tangent line to <m>g</m> at <m>(b,a)</m> is the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>(a,b)</m>,
      since these two lines are reflections of one another across the line <m>y = x</m>.

              To find a formula for <m>g = f^{-1}</m>,
              we take the equation <m>y = \frac{1}{4}x^3 + 4</m> and solve for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>.
              Doing so, we find that <m>y - 4 = \frac{1}{4}x^3</m>,
              so <m>x^3 = 4(y-4)</m>, and thus
              <me permid="sLA">
                x = \sqrt[3]{4(y-4)} = f^{-1}(y)
              </me>.
              Writing the inverse as a function of <m>x</m>,
              we have found that <m>f^{-1}(x) = g(x) = \sqrt[3]{4x-16}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="mHT">
            <p permid="LUx">
              First, <m>f'(x) = \frac{3}{4}x^2</m>,
              and thus <m>f'(2) = 3</m>.
              Next, <m>g'(x) = \frac{1}{3}(4x-16)^{-2/3} \cdot 4</m>,
              so that <m>g'(6) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 8^{-2/3} \cdot 4 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot 4 = \frac{1}{3}</m>.
              What is special about these two derivative values is that they happen to be reciprocals.

              Noting that <m>f(2) = 3</m> and <m>g(3) = 2</m>,
              we know that <m>g'(3) = \frac{1}{f'(2)}</m> by the rule for the derivative of an inverse function,
              and this matches our finding above that <m>g'(3) = \frac{1}{3}</m>.
