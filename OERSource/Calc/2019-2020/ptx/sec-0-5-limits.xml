<introduction>

    <p permid="riI">Limits are a mathematical construct we can use to describe the behavior of a function near a point.  Consider the function <m>g</m> given by the graph in 
      <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1">Figure</xref> below. We can evaluate the function at a variety of points.  For example, <m>g(-2)=0</m>, <m>g(-1)=3</m>, and <m>g(0)=1</m>.
    </p>
    
        <figure xml:id="F-1-2-PA1" permid="Dxa">
      <caption>Graph of <m>y = g(x)</m>.</caption>
      <image width="47%" source="images/1_2_PA1" />
    </figure>

<p>
A careful look at the graph above shows that <m>g</m> has a removable discontinuity at <m>x=0</m>, 
making <m>g(0)=1</m> even though the overall shape of the graph might lead us to expect <m>g(0)</m> to be <m>4</m>.
In fact, you would probably agree that <q>As <m>x</m> gets closer and closer
            (but not equal)
            to <m>0</m>,
            <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to <m>4</m>.</q>
This is the basic idea of a limit and we will expand on this idea in the following section.
</p>



</introduction>

  <subsection permid="BTI">
    <title>The Notion of Limit</title>
    <p permid="NMB">
      Limits give us a way to identify a trend in the values of a function as its input variable approaches a particular value of interest.
      We need a precise understanding of what it means to say 
      <q>a function <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>.</q> 
    </p>

    <p permid="tTK">
      In <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1">Figure</xref>,
      we saw that 
      as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer
      (but not equal)
      to 0, <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to the value 4.
      At first, this may feel counterintuitive,
      because the value of <m>g(0)</m> is <m>1</m>, not <m>4</m>.
      But limits describe the behavior of a function
      <em>arbitrarily close to</em> a fixed input
      and are not affected by the value of the function <em>at</em>
      the fixed input.
      More formally,<fn>
      What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit.
      To be completely precise,
      it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say
      <q>as close to <m>L</m> as we like</q>
      and <q>sufficiently close to <m>a</m>.</q>
      That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.
      That being said, the definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.
      </fn> we say the following.
    </p>



    <assemblage permid="upj"><title>Limit of a Function</title>

        <p permid="kzY">
          If a function <m>f</m> is defined on an interval around <m>c</m>, except perhaps at the point <m>x = c</m>,  we define the limit of the function <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> to be a number <m>L</m> (if one exists) such that <m>f(x)</m> is as close to  <m>L</m> as we want whenever <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>c</m> (but <m>x \neq c</m>). If <m>L</m> exists, we write <me>\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L</me>.


          On the other hand, if as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> we cannot make <m>f(x)</m> as close to a single value as we would like,
          then we say that <m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m>.
        </p>

    </assemblage>

    <example permid="aws">
      <statement>
        <p permid="QHh">
        Recall the function <m>g</m> from the section introduction, whose graph is reproduced below.
        
    <figure xml:id="F-1-2-PA1prime" permid="Dxa">
      <caption>Graph of <m>y = g(x)</m></caption>
      <image width="47%" source="images/1_2_PA1" />
    </figure>
        
          For the function <m>g</m> pictured in <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1prime">Figure</xref>,
          we make the following observations:
          <me permid="juF">
            \lim_{x \to -1} g(x) = 3, \  \lim_{x \to 0} g(x) = 4, \ \text{and}  \  \lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = 1
          </me>.
          When finding a limit from a graph,
          it suffices to ask if the function <em>approaches</em>
          a single value from each side of the fixed input.
          The function value <em>at</em> the fixed input is irrelevant.
          This reasoning explains the values of the three limits stated above.
        </p>

        <p permid="wOq">
          We further observe that <m>g</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m>  
          because there is a jump in the graph at <m>x = 1</m>.
          If we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the left,
          the function values tend to get close to 3,
          but if we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the right,
          the function values get close to 2.
          There is no single number that all of these function values approach.
          This is why the limit of <m>g</m> does not exist at <m>x = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p permid="aaT">
      For any function <m>f</m>,
      there are typically three ways to answer the question
      <q>does <m>f</m> have a limit at <m>x = a</m>, and if so,
      what is the limit?</q> The first is to reason graphically.
      If we have a formula for <m>f(x)</m>,
      there are two additional possibilities:

      <ol label="1" permid="DIV">
        <li permid="NcH">
          Evaluate the function at a sequence of inputs that approach <m>a</m> on either side
          (typically using some sort of computing technology),
          and ask if the sequence of outputs seems to approach a single value.
        </li>

        <li permid="tjQ">
          Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach <m>a</m>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      The first approach produces only an approximation of the value of the limit,
      while the latter can often be used to determine the limit exactly.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-1-2-Limits" permid="GDB">
      <statement>
        <p permid="cVz">
          For each of the following functions,
          we'd like to know whether or not the function has a limit at the stated <m>c</m>-values.
          Use both numerical and algebraic approaches to investigate and,
          if possible, estimate or determine the value of the limit.
          Compare the results with a careful graph of the function on an interval containing the points of interest.

        <p permid="ORU">
          From <xref ref="table-1-F-1-2-Ex1f">Table</xref>,
          it appears that we can make <m>f</m> as close as we want to 3 by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>-1</m>,
          which suggests that <m>\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = 3</m>.
          This is also consistent with the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> seen in <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1f">Figure</xref>.
          To see this a bit more rigorously and from an algebraic point of view,
          consider the formula for <m>f</m>:
          <m>f(x) = \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}</m>.
          As <m>x</m> approaches <m>-1</m>, the numerator, 
          <m>4-x^2</m>, of <m>f</m> approaches <m>4 - (-1)^2 = 3</m>,
          and the denominator, <m>x+2</m>, of <m>f</m> approaches <m>-1 + 2 = 1</m>. 
          Hence <m>\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = \frac{3}{1} = 3</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="uZd">
          The situation is more complicated when <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m>
          because <m>f(-2)</m> is not defined.
          If we try to use a similar algebraic argument regarding the numerator and denominator,
          we observe that as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m>,
          the numerator <m>(4-x^2)</m> approaches <m>(4 - (-2)^2) = 0</m>,
          and the denominator <m>(x+2)</m> approaches <m>(-2 + 2) = 0</m>, so as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m>,
          the numerator and denominator of <m>f</m> both tend to 0.
          We call <m>0/0</m> an <em>indeterminate form</em>.
              <idx><h>limit</h><h>indeterminate form</h></idx>
          This tells us that there is somehow more work to do.
          From <xref ref="table-2-F-1-2-Ex1f">Table</xref>
          and <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1f">Figure</xref>,
          it appears that <m>f</m> should have a limit of <m>4</m> at <m>x = -2</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="bgm">
          To see algebraically why this is the case, observe that
          <md permid="PBO">
            <mrow>\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = \amp  \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp  \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{(2-x)(2+x)}{x+2}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p permid="Hnv">
          It is important to observe that
          because we are taking the limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-2</m>,
          we are considering <m>x</m> values that are close,
          but not equal, to <m>-2</m>.
          Since we never actually allow <m>x</m> to equal <m>-2</m>,
          the quotient <m>\frac{2+x}{x+2}</m> has value 1 for every possible value of <m>x</m>.
          Thus, we can simplify the most recent expression above,
          and find that
          <me permid="vIX">
            \lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2} (2-x)
          </me>.
          This limit is now easy to determine,
          and its value is <m>4</m>.
          Thus, from several points of view we've seen that <m>\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = 4</m>.

          First, as <m>x</m> approaches <m>3</m>, it appears from the values in <xref ref="table-1-F-1-2-Ex1g">Table</xref>
          that the function is approaching a number between <m>0.86601</m> and <m>0.86604</m>.
          From the graph in <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1g">Figure</xref> it appears that <m>g(x)</m> approaches <m>g(3)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>3</m>.
          The exact value of <m>g(3) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{3})</m> is <m>\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>,
          which is approximately 0.8660254038.
          This is convincing evidence that
          <me permid="bQg">
            \lim_{x \to 3} g(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="zIW">
          As <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>, we observe that
          <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> does not behave in an elementary way.
          When <m>x</m> is positive and approaching zero,
          we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values,
          and <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> increases without bound.
          When <m>x</m> is negative and approaching zero,
          <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> decreases without bound.
          In this sense, as we get close to <m>x = 0</m>,
          the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly,
          and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of <m>g</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>.
          If we plot the function
          <m>g(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)</m> with a graphing utility and then zoom in on <m>x = 0</m>,
          we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin,
          which suggests that <m>g</m> does not have a limit at <m>x = 0</m>.

          How do we reconcile the graph in <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1g">Figure</xref> with <xref ref="table-2-F-1-2-Ex1g">Table</xref>,
          which seems to suggest that the limit of <m>g</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m> may in fact be <m>0</m>?
          The data misleads us because of the special nature of the sequence of input values <m>\{0.1, 0.01, 0.001, \ldots\}</m>.
          When we evaluate <m>g(10^{-k})</m>,
          we get <m>g(10^{-k}) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{10^{-k}}\right) = \sin(10^k \pi) = 0</m> for each positive integer value of <m>k</m>.
          But if we take a different sequence of values approaching zero,
          say <m>\{0.3, 0.03, 0.003, \ldots\}</m>, then we find that
          <me permid="HXp">
            g(3 \cdot 10^{-k}) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3 \cdot 10^{-k}}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{10^k \pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866025

        <p permid="LXo">
          That sequence of function values suggests that the value of the limit is <m>\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>.
          Clearly the function cannot have two different values for the limit,
          so <m>g</m> has no limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>.

      (but not equal to)
      <m>c</m>.
      If so, we write
      <m>\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L</m>.
      
      We also saw that there are cases where a function can fail to have a limit.  The graphs that follow are two such examples.

        <figure xml:id="F-1-7-NoLimit" permid="TXz">

    <p permid="WSf">
      Essentially there are two behaviors that a function can exhibit near a point where it fails to have a limit.
      In <xref ref="F-1-7-NoLimit">Figure</xref> above,
      at the left we see a function <m>f</m> whose graph shows a jump at <m>c = 1</m>.
      If we let <m>x</m> approach 1 from the left side,
      the value of <m>f</m> approaches 2, but if we let <m>x</m> approach <m>1</m> from the right,
      the value of <m>f</m> tends to 3.
      Because the value of <m>f</m> does not approach a single number as <m>x</m> gets arbitrarily close to 1 from both sides,
      we know that <m>f</m> does not have a limit at <m>c = 1</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="CZo">
      For such cases, we introduce the notion of
      <em>left</em> and <em>right</em>
      (or <em>one-sided</em>)
      limits.

      Precisely because the left and right limits are not equal,
      the overall limit of <m>f</m> as <m>x \to 1</m> fails to exist.

      For the function <m>g</m> pictured at the right of <xref ref="F-1-7-NoLimit">Figure</xref>,
      the function fails to have a limit at <m>c = 1</m> for a different reason.
      While the function does not have a jump in its graph at <m>c = 1</m>,
      it is still not the case that <m>g</m> approaches a single value as <m>x</m> approaches 1.
      In particular,
      due to the infinitely oscillating behavior of <m>g</m> to the right of <m>c = 1</m>,
      we say that the (right-hand) limit of <m>g</m> as <m>x \to 1^+</m> does not exist,

    <title>Limits and Continuity</title>

    <p permid="AeI">
      Recall that informally we said
      a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without ever lifting our pencil from the page.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-7-Cont" permid="kVK">

      Using limits, we can formalize the idea of continuity.
      First consider the function in the left-most graph of <xref ref="F-1-7-Cont">Figure</xref> above.
      Note that <m>f(1)</m> is not defined,
      which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>c = 1</m>.
      We will naturally say that <m>f</m> is
      <em>not continuous at <m>c = 1</m></em>.
      For the function <m>g</m>,
      we observe that while <m>\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 3</m>,
      the value of <m>g(1)</m> is <m>2</m>,
      and thus the limit does not equal the function value.
      Here, too, we will say that <m>g</m> is
      <em>not continuous</em>,
      even though the function is defined at <m>c = 1</m>.
      Finally, the function <m>h</m> appears to be the most well-behaved of all three,
      since at <m>c = 1</m> its limit and its function value agree.
      That is,
      <me permid="SSg">
        \lim_{x \to 1} h(x) = 3 = h(1)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Mta">
      With no hole or jump in the graph of <m>h</m> at <m>c = 1</m>,
      we say that <m>h</m> is
      <em>continuous</em> there.
      More formally, we make the following definition.

      Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c),

      The definition says that a function is continuous at <m>x = c</m> provided that its limit as <m>x \to c</m> exists and equals its function value at <m>x = c</m>.
      If a function is continuous at every point in an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      we say the function is <q>continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>.</q>
      If a function is continuous at every point in its domain,
      we simply say the function is <q>continuous.</q> Thus we note that
      continuous functions are particularly nice:
      to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point,
      all we need to do is evaluate the function.

      For example, consider <m>p(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3</m>.
      It can be proved that every polynomial is a continuous function at every real number,

    <p permid="EOB">
      This route of substituting an input value to evaluate a limit works whenever we know that the function being considered is continuous.
      Besides polynomial functions,
      all exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions are continuous at every point,
      as are many other familiar functions and combinations thereof.

    <subsection><title>Summary of Limits and Continuity</title>
        <p>The concepts discussed in the last two sections will be important in later sections. The following is a short summary of these sections and an example that ties together the concepts of limits and continuity.
        <ul>
            <li>For a function <m>f</m> defined on an interval around a number <m>c</m>, <me>\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L</me> means that the value of <m>f(x)</m> gets as close as we want to a number <m>L</m> whenever <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>c</m>, assuming the value <m>L</m> exists.</li>
            <li>We define a limit from the left and a limit from the right in the same way as above, while adding the stipulation that <m>x\lt c</m> for the left limit and <m>x\gt c</m> for the right limit. That is, as we move <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>c</m> <em>from the left</em> on a number line (<m>x\lt c</m>), <m>f(x)</m> gets as close to the limit value as we want. Similarly for the limit from the right.</li>
            <li>The one-sided limits help to determine if a limit exists as <m>x</m> approaches a value <m>c</m>. More specifically, <m>\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L</m> if and only if <m>\lim_{x \rightarrow c^-} f(x)=L=\lim_{x \rightarrow c^+} f(x)</m> </li>
            <li>Limits also help us determine the continuity of a function at a point <m>x=c</m>. A function <m>f</m> that has a limit as <m>x\rightarrow c</m>, is defined at <m>x=c</m>, and <m>\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)=f(c)</m> is continuous at <m>x=c</m>.</li>
