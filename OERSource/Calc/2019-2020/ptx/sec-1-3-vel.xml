      a ball is tossed straight up in the air.

    should be feet per second. These are units of velocity, and in fact the value of 
    <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m> is the average velocity on the time interval <m>0.5\le t\le1</m>.
    Moreover, the formula for <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m> is precisely the slope formula between

     The <em>position</em>
          <idx><h>position</h></idx>
      of any moving object can be considered as a function of <em>time</em>.
      When the motion is along a straight line,
      the position is given by a single variable,
      which we denote by <m>s(t)</m>.
      For example,
      <m>s(t)</m> might give the mile marker of a car traveling on a straight highway at time <m>t</m> in hours.
      Similarly, the function <m>s(t)</m> described in <xref ref="PA-1-1">Example</xref> is a position function,
      where the position of a ball is measured vertically relative to the ground.
    </p>

    <p permid="vuC">
      On any time interval, a moving object also has an
      <em>average velocity</em>.
      For example,
      to compute a car's average velocity we divide the number of miles traveled by the time elapsed,
      which gives the velocity in <em>miles per hour</em>.
      Similarly, the value of <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m> in <xref ref="PA-1-1">Example</xref>
      gave the average velocity of the ball on the time interval <m>[0.5,1]</m>,
      measured in feet per second.

    <title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>
    <p permid="TXm">
      Whether we are driving a car,
      riding a bike, or throwing a ball,
      we have an intuitive sense that a moving object has a velocity at any given moment --- a number that measures how fast the object is moving <em>right now</em>.
      For instance,
      a car's speedometer tells the driver the car's velocity at any given instant.
      In fact, the velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval.
      If we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter,
      we can progress from average velocity to
      <em>instantaneous</em> velocity.
    </p>

    <p permid="Aev">
      Informally, we define the instantaneous velocity
          <idx><h>instantaneous velocity</h></idx>
      of a moving object at time <m>t = a</m> to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing <m>t = a</m>.
      We will develop a more formal definition of instantaneous velocity soon,
      and this definition will be the foundation of much of our work in calculus.
      For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity as follows:
      take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals around a specific point.
      If those average velocities approach a single number,
      then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.

              which it must,
              since as <m>h</m> changes the average velocity will change.
              Further, we note that since <m>h</m> can never equal zero,
              we may remove the common factor of <m>h</m> from the numerator and denominator.

              From this expression we can compute the average velocity on <m>[0.5,0.5+h]</m> for any small positive or negative value of <m>h</m>.

      it follows that <m>AV_{[1.5,2]} = -32 + 16(0.5) = -24</m> ft/sec.
      Likewise, as we let <m>h</m> approach zero,

        According to the U.S. census,

            Just like we can find the average velocity of a moving body by computing change in position over change in time,

            In particular, the <em>average rate of change</em>
