    <p permid="YsX">
      Given a differentiable function <m>y= f(x)</m>,
      we know that its derivative, <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      is a related function whose output at <m>x=a</m> tells us the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      That is, <m>y</m>-coordinates on the derivative graph tell us the values of slopes on the original function's graph.
    </p>

    <p permid="EAg">
      At a point where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive,
      the slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> is positive.
      Therefore, on an interval where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive,
      the function <m>f</m> is increasing
      (or rising).
          <idx><h>increasing</h></idx>
      Similarly,
      if <m>f'(x)</m> is negative on an interval,
      the graph of <m>f</m> is decreasing
          <idx><h>decreasing</h></idx>
      (or falling).
    </p>

    <p permid="kHp">
      The derivative of <m>f</m> tells us not only <em>whether</em>
      the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing on an interval,
      but also <em>how</em> the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing.
      Look at the two tangent lines shown below in <xref ref="F-1-6-Intro">Figure</xref>.
      We see that at point <m>A</m>
      the value of <m>f'(x)</m> is positive and relatively close to zero,
      and at that point the graph is rising slowly.
      By contrast, at point <m>B</m>,
      the derivative is negative and relatively large in absolute value,
      and <m>f</m> is decreasing rapidly at <m>B</m>.

    <p permid="QOy">
      Besides asking whether the value of the derivative function is positive or negative and whether it is large or small,
      we can also ask <q>how is the derivative changing?</q>
    </p>

    <p permid="wVH">
      Because the derivative,
      <m>y = f'(x)</m>, is itself a function,
      we can consider taking its derivative <mdash /> the derivative of the derivative <mdash /> and ask
      <q>what does the derivative of the derivative tell us about how the original function behaves?</q>

    <title>Second Derivative</title>
        <p>
          The <term>second derivative</term>
          is defined by applying the limit definition of the derivative to the first derivative.
          That is,
          <me permid="olP">
            f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}
          </me>.
          We read <q><m>f''(x)</m></q> as <q><m>f</m>-double prime of <m>x</m></q>,
          or as <q>the second derivative of <m>f</m></q>.
        </p>
    </assemblage>
    </p>

    <p permid="aik">
      The meaning of the derivative function still holds,
      so when we compute <m>f''(x)</m>,
      this new function measures slopes of tangent lines to the curve <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      as well as the instantaneous rate of change of <m>y = f'(x)</m>.
      In other words,
      just as the first derivative measures the rate at which the original function changes,
      the <em>second</em> derivative measures the rate at which the <em>first</em> derivative changes.
      The second derivative will help us understand how the rate of change of the original function is itself changing.

    <p permid="Gpt">
      In addition to asking <em>whether</em>
      a function is increasing or decreasing,
      it is also natural to inquire <em>how</em>
      a function is increasing or decreasing.
      There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval,
      as pictured below in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>:
      the function can increase more and more rapidly,
      it can increase at the same rate,
      or it can increase in a way that is slowing down.
      Fundamentally,
      we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends,
      with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all.
      More than this,
      we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-6-3optsi" permid="jBW">
      <caption>Three functions that are all increasing, but doing so at an increasing rate, at a constant rate, and at a decreasing rate, respectively.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/1_6_3optsi" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="mwC">
      On the leftmost curve in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>,
      draw a sequence of tangent lines to the curve.
      As we move from left to right,
      the slopes of those tangent lines will increase.
      Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing,
      and this explains why we say this function is
      <em>increasing at an increasing rate</em>.
      For the rightmost graph in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>,
      observe that as <m>x</m> increases,
      the function increases, but the slopes of the tangent lines decrease.
      This function is <em>increasing at a decreasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="SDL">
      Similar options hold for how a function can decrease.
      Here we must be extra careful with our language,
      because decreasing functions involve negative slopes.<fn>
      Negative numbers present an interesting tension between common language and mathematical language.
      For example, it can be tempting to say that
      <q><m>-100</m> is bigger than <m>-2</m>.</q>
      But we must remember that <q>greater than</q>
      describes how numbers lie on a number line:
      <m>x \gt y</m> provided that <m>x</m> lies to the right of <m>y</m>.
      So of course, <m>-100</m> is less than <m>-2</m>.
      Informally, it might be helpful to say that
      <q><m>-100</m> is more negative than <m>-2</m>.</q>
      </fn>
      When a function's values are negative,
      and those values get more negative as the input increases,
      the function must be decreasing.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-6-3optsd" permid="PJf">
      <caption>From left to right, three functions that are all decreasing, but doing so in different ways.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/1_6_3optsd" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="yKU">
      Now consider the three graphs shown above in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsd">Figure</xref>.
      The middle graph clearly depicts a function decreasing at a constant rate.
      Now draw a sequence of tangent lines on the first curve.
      We see that the slopes of these lines get closer to zero <mdash /> meaning they get
      less and less negative <mdash /> as we move from left to right.
      That means that the values of the first derivative,
      while all negative, are increasing,
      and thus we say that the leftmost curve is
      <em>decreasing at an increasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="eSd">
      This leaves only the rightmost curve in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsd">Figure</xref> to consider.
      For that function,
      the slopes of the tangent lines are negative throughout the pictured interval,
      but as we move from left to right,
      the slopes get more and more negative as they get steeper.
      Hence the slope of the curve is decreasing,
      and we say that the function is
      <em>decreasing at a decreasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="KZm">
      We now introduce the notion of <em>concavity</em>,
          <idx><h>concavity</h></idx>
      which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors.
      When a curve opens upward on a given interval,
      like the parabola <m>y = x^2</m> or the exponential growth function <m>y = e^x</m>,
      we say that the curve is <em>concave up</em> on that interval.
      Likewise, when a curve opens down,
      like the parabola <m>y = -x^2</m> or the negative exponential function <m>y = -e^{x}</m>,
      we say that the function is <em>concave down</em>.
      Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.
    </p>

    <p permid="rgv">
      In <xref ref="F-1-6-concavity">Figure</xref> below,
      we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each.
      The lefthand plot shows a function that is concave up; observe that here the tangent lines
      always lie below the curve itself, and the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing
      as we move from left to right.
      In other words,
      the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative,
      <m>f'</m>, is increasing on that interval.
      Similarly, the righthand plot in <xref ref="F-1-6-concavity">Figure</xref>
      depicts a function that is concave down;
      in this case, we see that the tangent lines alway lie above the curve
      and that the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right.
      The fact that its derivative,
      <m>f'</m>, is decreasing makes <m>f</m> concave down on the interval shown.

<subsection><title>Acceleration</title><p>
Recall that if the function <m>s(t)</m> gave the position of an object at time <m>t</m> then <m>s'(t)</m> gave the change in position, otherwise known as velocity.  
That is, <m>s'(t)=v(t)</m>, where <m>v(t)</m> is the velocity function.  
Using the alternate notation introduced in <xref ref="sec-1-5-units">Section</xref> we have <m>\frac{ds}{dt}=v(t)</m>.
</p> 

<p>Following this same idea, <m>v'(t)</m> gives the change in velocity, more commonly called acceleration.  
Using derivative notation, <m>v'(t)=a(t)</m>.  Therefore, <m>s''(t)=a(t)</m>.  
That is, the second derivative of the position function gives acceleration.  
Using the alternative notation from <xref ref="sec-1-5-units-ss-1">the previous section</xref>, we write <m>\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}=a(t)</m>.<fn>
Notice that in higher order derivatives the exponent occurs in what appear to be different locations in the numerator and denominator.  
In reality, what is happening is we have <m>\frac{d^{n}}{dt^{n}}</m> acting as an operator that takes the <m>n</m>th order derivative of the function. </fn>


</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Suppose that an object's velocity is given by the graph in the figure below.

<ol label="a">
<li> On what intervals is the acceleration positive?</li>
<li> On what intervals is the object's position increasing?</li>
<li> Where is the function <m>s(t)</m> concave up?</li>

<li> Recall that acceleration is given by the derivative of the velocity function.</li>

</ol>
</p>
</answer>


<solution>
<p>
<ol label="a">
<li> Recall that acceleration is given by the derivative of the velocity function.  Therefore, we can say that acceleration is positive whenever the velocity function is increasing.  Since the graph in <xref ref="F-1-6-last">Figure</xref> depicts the velocity function, it follows that the object's acceleration is positive exactly on the intervals <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(3,4)</m>.</li>
<li> We know that a function is increasing whenever its derivative is positive, and that velocity, <m>v</m>, is the derivative of position, <m>s</m>, with respect to time, <m>t</m>. Inspection of <xref ref="F-1-6-last">Figure</xref> shows that the <m>v(t)</m> is positive only on <m>(0,2)</m>, so the object's position is increasing on that same interval.</li>
<li> Recall that a function is concave up when its second derivative is positive, which is when its first derivative is increasing. In (a) we saw that the acceleration is positive on <m>(0,1)\cup(3,4)</m>; as acceleration is the second derivative of position, these are the intervals where the graph of <m>y=s(t)</m> is concave up.</li>

              Whenever <m>g'</m> is increasing, <m>g''</m> is positive,

              Hence, whenever <m>g'</m> changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa,

              We therefore see that while <m>g</m> is always increasing,
