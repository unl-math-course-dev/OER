    <p permid="JFY">
      Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative,
      and the definition of the derivative involves a limit,
      there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits.
      Limits in which evaluating the numerator and denominator at the limit point separately results in the fraction <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> are called indeterminate form.
      When we come across a limit like this we have some work to do.
      Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do:
      indeed, limits of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> can take on any value.
    </p>

    <p permid="pNh">
      We have learned many techniques for evaluating the limits,
      including a large number of shortcut rules.
      In this section,
      we explore how to use derivatives to evaluate certain limits.

    <p permid="VUq">
      The idea demonstrated in <xref ref="PA-2-8">Example</xref>
      <mdash /> that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest <mdash /> can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits.
      Given a function <m>h(x)</m> that can be written as a quotient
      <m>h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>,
      where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both differentiable at <m>x=a</m> and for which <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>.
      We would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} h(x)</m>.
      <xref ref="F-2-8-LHR">Figure</xref> illustrates the situation.
      We see that both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have an <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x = a</m>.
      Their respective tangent line approximations <m>L_f</m> and <m>L_g</m> at <m>x = a</m>
      are also shown in the figure.
      We can take advantage of the fact that a function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as <m>x \to a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Cbz">
      First, let's recall that <m>L_f(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)</m> and <m>L_g(x) = g'(a)(x-a) +g(a)</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is getting arbitrarily close to <m>a</m> when we take the limit,
      we can replace <m>f</m> with <m>L_f</m> and replace <m>g</m> with <m>L_g</m>,
      and thus we observe that
      <md permid="iSC">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)}{g'(a)(x-a) + g(a)}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iiI">
      Next, we remember that both <m>f(a) = 0</m> and <m>g(a) = 0</m>,
      which is precisely what makes the original limit indeterminate.
      Substituting these values for <m>f(a)</m> and <m>g(a)</m> in the limit above,
      we now have
      <md permid="vgU">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a)}{g'(a)(x-a)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</mrow>
      </md>,
      where the latter equality holds because
      <m>\frac{x-a}{x-a} = 1</m> when <m>x</m> is approaching
      (but not equal to) <m>a</m>.
      Finally, we note that <m>\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m> is constant with respect to <m>x</m>, and thus
      <me permid="OZL">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OpR">
      This result holds as long as <m>g'(a)</m> is not equal to zero.
      The formal name of the result is L'Hpital's Rule.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="KLr">
      <title>L'Hpital's Rule</title>
      <idx><h>L'Hpital's rule</h></idx>

      <p permid="uxa">
        Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable at <m>x=a</m>,
        and suppose that <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m> and that <m>g'(a) \neq 0</m>.
        Then <me>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}.</me>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="aEj">
      In practice,
      we typically work with a slightly more general version of L'Hpital's Rule,
      which states that (under the identical assumptions as the boxed rule above and the extra assumption that <m>g'</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>)
      <me permid="bod">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
      </me>,
      provided the righthand limit exists.
      This form reflects the basic idea of L'Hpital's Rule:
      if <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> produces an indeterminate limit of form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> as <m>x \to a</m>,
      that limit is equivalent to the limit of the quotient of the two functions' derivatives,
      <m>\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="GLs">
      For example,
      if we consider the limit from <xref ref="PA-2-8">Example</xref>,
      <me permid="Hvm">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1}
      </me>,
      by L'Hpital's Rule we have that
      <me permid="nCv">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{5x^4 + 1}{2x} = \frac{6}{2} = 3. \\
      </me>
    </p>

    <p permid="mSB">
      By replacing the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives,
      we often replace an indeterminate limit with one whose value we can easily determine.

    <title>Limits involving <m>\infty</m></title>
    <p permid="XJD">
      The concept of infinity,
          <idx><h>infinity</h></idx>
      denoted <m>\infty</m>, arises naturally in calculus,
      as it does in much of mathematics.
      It is important to note from the outset that <m>\infty</m> is a concept,
      but not a number itself.
      Indeed, the notion of <m>\infty</m> naturally invokes the idea of limits.
      Consider, for example, the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>,
      whose graph is pictured in <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p permid="DQM">
      We note that <m>x = 0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      so we may naturally wonder what happens as <m>x \to 0</m>.
      As <m>x \to 0^+</m>, we observe that <m>f(x)</m>
      <em>increases without bound</em>.
      That is, we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> closer and closer
      (but not equal)
      to 0, while keeping <m>x \gt 0</m>.
      This is a good way to think about what infinity represents:
      a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-8-Infty" permid="KpS">
      <caption>The graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>.</caption>
      <image width="47%" source="images/2_8_Infty" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="jXV">
      Recall that the statement <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L</m>,
      means that can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>.
      We now expand this notation and language to include the possibility that either <m>L</m> or <m>a</m> can be <m>\infty</m>.
      For instance, for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we now write
      <me permid="zQN">
        \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty
      </me>,
      by which we mean that we can make
      <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to 0.
      In a similar way, we write
      <me permid="fXW">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
      </me>,
      since we can make <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as close to 0 as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large (i.e., by letting <m>x</m> increase without bound).
    </p>

    <p permid="Qfe">
      In general, the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty</m> means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>, and the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L</m>  means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      This notation also applies to left- and right-hand limits,
      and to limits involving <m>-\infty</m>.
      For example, returning to <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>
      and <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we can say that
      <me permid="Mff">
        \lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="wmn">
      Finally, we write
      <me permid="smo">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      if we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      For example,

      For the exponential decay function <m>e^{-x}</m>,
      these limits are reversed,
      with <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{-x} = 0</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} e^{-x} = \infty</m>.
      Turning to the natural logarithm function,

      To evaluate the limit of a quotient of two functions
      <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> that results in an indeterminate form of <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>,
      in essence we are asking which function is growing faster without bound.
      We say that the function <m>g</m> <em>dominates</em>
      the function <m>f</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m> provided that
      <me permid="BGa">

      we say that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
      <em>grow at the same rate</em>.
      For example,
      we saw that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0</m>,
      so <m>e^x</m> dominates <m>x^2</m>,
      while <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 5}{7x^2 + 9x - 10} = \frac{3}{7}</m>,

    <title>Other Indeterminate Forms</title>
    <p>While the main two indeterminate forms are <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> and <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>, there are other indeterminate forms which can be rewritten in order to use L'Hopital's Rule.</p>
    
    <p>The following example is a classic use of L'Hopital's Rule.</p>
    
    <example><p>Evaluate each of the following limit.
      If you use L'Hopital's Rule,
      indicate where it was used,
      and be certain its hypotheses are met before you apply it.
      <me>\lim_{x\to \infty}(1+1/x)^x</me></p>
    
      <p>Notice that <m>1+\frac{1}{x}\to 1</m> as <m>x\to\infty</m>. So this limit takes the form <m>1^{\infty}</m>, which is an indeterminate form.</p>
      
      <p>We need a couple extra steps before we can apply L'Hopital's Rule. First, let's set <m>y=(1+1/x)^x</m>. Note that <m>\ln(y)=\ln(1+1/x)^x=x\ln(1+1/x).</m> Then <me>\lim_{x\to\infty}(1+1/x)^x=\lim_{x\to\infty}y=\lim_{x\to\infty}e^{\ln(y)}=e^{\lim_{x\to\infty}\ln(y)}.</me></p>
      
      <p>Therefore, we need to evaluate <m>\lim_{x\to\infty}\ln(y)=\lim_{x\to\infty}x\ln(1+1/x).</m></p>
      <p>As <m>x\to\infty</m> this limit approaches <m>\infty\cdot 0</m>, which is another indeterminate form. We still have not met the conditions to apply L'Hopital's rule, but are getting closer. We can rewrite the limit in the following way <me>\lim_{x\to\infty}x\ln(1+1/x)=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\ln(1+1/x)}{1/x}.</me></p>
      
      <p>This limit has the indeterminate form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>, so we can apply L'Hopital's Rule at this point: <me>\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\ln(1+1/x)}{1/x}=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{1+1/x)\cdot\frac{-1}{x^2}}}{-1/x^2}=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{1+1/x}=1.</me></p>
      
      <p>So finally, we have <me>\lim_{x\to\infty}(1+1/x)^x=e^{1}=e.</me></p>
    </example>
    
    <p>The other indeterminate forms include <m>0\cdot\infty</m>, <m>\infty-\infty</m>, <m>1^{\infty}</m>, <m>0^0</m>, and <\infty^0</m>. The following examples demonstrate a few of these other forms.</p>

      <p permid="JCH">
        First, we note that since both the numerator and denominator of <m>R</m> are quadratic,
        the limit as <m>x \to \infty</m> can be found by taking the quotient of the leading coefficients.
        In particular,
        <me permid="wiW">
          \lim_{x \to \infty} R(x) = \frac{3}{5}
        </me>
        and thus the horizontal asymptote of <m>R</m> is <m>y = \frac{3}{5}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="pJQ">
        Next, since <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are distinct,
        we see that the numerator of <m>R</m> is zero
        (and the denominator is not)
        when <m>x = b</m>, and thus <m>R(b) = 0</m>.
        In addition, the denominator is zero
        (and the numerator is not)
        when <m>x = c</m>,
        and this results in there being a vertical asymptote at <m>x = c</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="VQZ">
        Finally, we observe that <m>x = a</m> makes both the numerator and denominator zero.
        Since <m>R(a)</m> is thus not defined,
        the graph of <m>R</m> has either a hole or a vertical asymptote at <m>x = a</m>.
        To determine which, we evaluate the limit and see that
        <me permid="cqf">
          \lim_{x \to a} \frac{3(x-a)(x-b)}{5(x-a)(x-c)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{3(x-b)}{5(x-c)} = \frac{3(a-b)}{5(a-c)}
        </me>.
        This tells us that <m>R</m> has a hole at the point <m>(a, \frac{3(a-b)}{5(a-c)})</m>.

              We note that both  <m>\ln(x)</m> or

              so we consider

                \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt{x}}

              By L'Hpital's Rule and some simplifying algebra,
              <me permid="Zvz">
                \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt{x}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{2x^{1/2}}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2x^{1/2}}{x} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2}{x^{1/2}}
              </me>.
              Thus, it follows that
              <me permid="FCI">
                \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt{x}} = 0

              Using a similar argument to our work in <m>(a)</m>,
              we can show that <m>\sqrt[n]{x}</m> dominates <m>\ln(x)</m> for any positive integer <m>n</m>.
              In particular, by L'Hpital's Rule and some simplifying algebra,
              <me permid="lJR">
                \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt[n]{x}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{nx^{(n-1)/n}}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{nx^{(n-1)/n}}{x}
              </me>.
              Since <m>\frac{x^{(n-1)/n}}{x} = x^{(n-1)/n - 1} = x^{(n-1-n)/n} = x^{-1/n}</m>,
              it follows that

              we've shown that <m>\sqrt[n]{x}</m> dominates <m>\ln(x)</m> for any positive integer <m>n</m>.

              To see why <m>e^x</m> will dominate any polynomial function,
              consider <m>p(x) = x^4</m>.
              If we consider the limit of their quotient and apply LHR once,
              we see that
              <me permid="xYj">
                \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^4}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{4x^3}{e^x}
              </me>
              By repeated application of LHR, the numerator
              (regardless of what polynomial we start with)
              will eventually be simply a constant
              (after <m>n</m> applications of LHR),
              and thus with <m>e^x</m> still in the denominator,
              the overall limit will be <m>0</m>.

              Here we naturally consider the limit of the quotient of <m>\ln(x)</m> and <m>x^n</m>,
              where <m>n \ge 1</m>.
              Since both functions increase without bound,
              we can apply LHR.  Doing so along with some simplifying algebra, we see
              <me permid="efs">
                \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln(x)}{x^n} =  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{nx^{n-1}} = \frac{1}{nx^n} = 0
