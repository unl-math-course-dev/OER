    <title>What is a differential equation?</title>
    <idx><h>differential equation</h></idx>



    <p permid="EQb">
      Differential equations arise frequently in our every day world.
      For instance, you may hear a bank advertising:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="hsK">
      <p permid="HKH">
        <em>Your money will grow at a 3<percent /> annual interest rate with us.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="kXk">
      This innocuous statement is really a differential equation.
      Let's
      translate: <m>A(t)</m> will be amount of money you have in your account at
      time <m>t</m>.
      The rate at which your money grows is the
      derivative <m>dA/dt</m>, and we are told that this rate is
      <m>0.03 A</m>.
      This leads to the differential equation
      <me permid="oBK">
        \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.03 A
      </me>.
    </p>




    <p permid="Ret">
      This differential equation has a slightly different feel than the previous equation <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1</m>.
      In the earlier example,
      the rate of change depends only on the independent variable <m>t</m>,
      and we may find <m>s(t)</m> by integrating the velocity <m>4t+1</m>.
      In the banking example, however,
      the rate of change depends on the dependent variable <m>A</m>,
      so we'll need some new techniques in order to find <m>A(t)</m>.
    </p>

<example xml:id="act-7-1-1" permid="DUv">
  <statement>
    <p permid="mWk">
      Express the following statements as
      differential equations.
      In each case, you will need to introduce notation
      to describe the important quantities in the statement so be sure to
      clearly state what your notation means.

    <title>Differential equations in the world around us</title>
    <p permid="xlC">
      Differential equations give a natural way to describe phenomena we see in the real world.
      For instance,
      physical principles are frequently expressed as a description of how a quantity changes.
      A good example is Newton's Second Law,
      which says:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="NzT">
      <p permid="nRQ">
        <em>The product of an object's mass and acceleration equals the force applied to it. </em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="dsL">
      For instance,
      when gravity acts on an object near the earth's surface,
      it exerts a force equal to <m>mg</m>,
      the mass of the object times the
      gravitational constant <m>g</m>.
      We therefore have
      <md permid="UIT">
        <mrow>ma =\mathstrut \amp  mg, \ \text{or}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{dv}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  g</mrow>
      </md>,
      where <m>v</m> is the velocity of the object,
      and <m>g = 9.8</m> meters per
      second squared.
      Notice that this physical principle does not tell us
      what the object's
      velocity is, but rather how the object's velocity changes.

    <p permid="pHd">
      A differential equation describes the derivative,
      or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us.
      By a <em>solution</em> to a differential equation,
      we mean simply a function that satisies this description.
    </p>

    <p permid="VOm">
      For instance, the first differential equation we looked at is
      <me permid="AQc">
        \frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1
      </me>,
      which describes an unknown function <m>s(t)</m>.
      We may check that <m>s(t) =
      2t^2+t</m> is a solution because it satisfies this description.
      Notice
      that <m>s(t) = 2t^2+t+4</m> is also a solution.
    </p>

    <p permid="BVv">
      If we have a candidate for a solution, it is straightforward to
      check whether it is a solution or not.
      Before we demonstrate,
      however, let's consider the same issue in a simpler context.
      Suppose we are given the equation
      <m>2x^2 - 2x = 2x+6</m> and asked whether <m>x=3</m> is a solution.
      To answer
      this question,
      we could rewrite the variable <m>x</m> in the equation with
      the symbol <m>\Box</m>:
      <me permid="gXl">
        2\Box^2 - 2\Box = 2\Box + 6
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="icE">
      To determine whether <m>x=3</m> is a solution,
      we can investigate the value of each side of the equation separately when the value <m>3</m> is placed in <m>\Box</m> and see if indeed the two resulting values are equal.
      Doing so, we observe that
      <me permid="Neu">
        2\Box^2 - 2\Box = 2\cdot3^2 - 2\cdot3 = 12
      </me>,
      and
      <me permid="tlD">
        2\Box + 6 = 2\cdot3 + 6 = 12
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OjN">
      Therefore, <m>x=3</m> is indeed a solution.
    </p>

    <p permid="uqW">
      We will do the same thing with differential equations.
      Consider
      the differential equation
      <md permid="ZsM">
        <mrow>\frac{dv}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5 - 0.5v, \ \text{or}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{d\Box}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5 - 0.5\Box</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ayf">
      Let's ask whether <m>v(t) = 3 - 2e^{-0.5t}</m> is a solution<fn>
      At this time,
      don't worry about why we chose this function;  we will learn
      techniques for finding solutions to differential equations soon enough.
      </fn>.
      Using this formula for <m>v</m>, observe first that
      <me permid="FzV">
        \frac{dv}{dt} =  \frac{d\Box}{dt}  = \frac{d}{dt}[3 - 2e^{-0.5t}] = -2e^{-0.5t} \cdot (-0.5) = e^{-0.5t}
      </me>
      and
      <me permid="lHe">
        1.5 - 0.5v = 1.5 - 0.5\Box= 1.5 - 0.5(3 - 2e^{-0.5t}) = 1.5 - 1.5 + e^{-0.5t} = e^{-0.5t}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="GFo">
      Since <m>\frac{dv}{dt}</m> and

    <p permid="STG">
      Notice that the value of <m>C</m> is connected to the initial value of the velocity <m>v(0)</m>,
      since <m>v(0) = 3+C</m>.
      In other words,
      while the differential equation describes how the velocity changes as a function of the velocity itself,
      this is not enough information to determine the velocity uniquely:
      we also need to know the initial velocity.
      For this reason,
      differential equations will typically have infinitely many solutions,
      one corresponding to each initial value.
      We have seen this phenomenon before:
      given the velocity of a moving object <m>v(t)</m>,
      we cannot uniquely determine the object's position function unless we also know its initial position.

    <p permid="zaP">
      If we are given a differential equation and an initial value for the

      <em>initial value problem.</em>

        \frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v, \ v(0) = 0.5

      In this problem, we know the value of
      <m>v</m> at one time and we know how <m>v</m> is changing.
      Consequently, there should
      be exactly one function <m>v</m> that satisfies the initial value problem.

              There are several reasons to think that <m>75</m> degrees F is room temperature:

              (which would match the room temperature),
              then its rate of change is <m>0</m> and the coffee's temperature doesn't change.

              What happens to this solution after a long time?
              Assuming that <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}</m>, we observe that
              <me permid="pja">
                \frac{dT}{dt} = 30e^{-t/15} \left(-\frac{1}{15} \right) = -2e^{-t/15}

              In addition,
              <me permid="Vqj">
                -\frac{1}{15}T + 5 = -\frac{1}{15}(75 + 30e^{-t/15}) + 5 = -5 - 2e^{-t/15} + 5 = -2e^{-t/15}
              </me>.
              The two preceding equations show that
              <me permid="Bxs">
                \frac{dT}{dt}= -\frac1{15}T+5
              </me>
              when we substitute <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}</m> in for <m>T</m>,
              and thus this function is a solution to the differential equation.
              Moreover, <m>T(0) = 75 + 30e^0 = 75 + 30 = 105</m>,
              so the function satisfies the initial condition, too.
              Finally, because <m>e^{-t/15} \to 0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>,
              it follows that <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15} \to 75</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>,
              which shows that the solution function's value tends to room temperature as time increases without bound,
              as we expect.
