      Just as we can use definite integrals to add the areas of rectangular slices to find the exact area that lies between two curves,
      we can also use integrals to find the volume of regions whose cross-sections have a particular shape.

      In particular,
      we can determine the volume of solids whose cross-sections are all thin cylinders
      (or washers) by adding up the volumes of these individual slices.

<title> Volume as the Integral of Cross-Sectional Area </title>


<p>
In the previous section, we saw that the way we find area of a 2D region is to cut it into thin rectangles, and then integrate the height of the rectangles.
The same principle lets us find the volume of a 3D shape: slice it into thin "cross-sections", and then integrate the area of the cross-sections.
So while the formula for area is

<me>
\text{Area}= \int_a^b f(x)\, dx
</me>

where <m> f(x) </m> is the height of the rectangle at <m> x </m>, and <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> are the endpoints, the formula for volume is

<me>
\text{Volume}= \int_a^b A(x)\, dx
</me>

where <m> A(x) </m> is the area of the cross-section at <m> x </m>, and <m> a </m> and <m> a </m> are the endpoints. 
In <xref ref="PA-6-2">Example</xref>, we saw that the cross-sections were circles, so we used the circle area formula to get <m>A(x)=\pi r^2=\pi (-\frac 35 x +3)^2</m>,
and integrated from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=5</m> since those were the top and bottom of the cone.

</p>

<p>
For 2D shapes, it is sometimes more convenient to integrate with respect to <m>y</m> instead of <m>x</m>, and the same is true for 3D shapes. 
In fact, one may want to integrate with respect to <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m>, and you should try to choose the variable of integration so that all of your cross-sections are the same shape.
For instance, in <xref ref="PA-6-2">Example</xref>, we integrated with respect to <m>x</m> so that the cross-sections were all circles. 
If we had taken slices in another direction, the area of a cross-section would have been much more complicated and the integral would have been much harder!


</p>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
    Consider a pyramid with a 1-by-1 square base along the <m>xy</m>-plane with corners at <m> (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,0)</m>, and tapering up to a point at <m>(0,0,2)</m>. 
    [Include a figure.]
    Notice that every <m>z</m>-cross-section (parallel to the <m>xy</m>-plane) is a square, so we will want to integrate with respect to <m>z</m>.
    	<ol label="a.">
           
           <li>
           <p>
      		   Cutting the pyramid at a <m>z</m>-value between 0 and 1 gives a square shape. 
      		   Find the linear function <m>f(z)</m> that gives the side-length of this square.
      		   </p>
           </li>
          <li>
          <p>
             Since the <m>z</m>-cross-sections are squares, so we will want to integrate with respect to <m>z</m>. Therefore, the volume of our pyramid is 
             <me>
             Volume = \int_a^b A(z) dz
             </me>
             The endpoints <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> represent the <m>z</m>-values where the pyramid starts and stops. What are <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>?
           </p>
           </li>
             <li>
             <p>
             Combine your answers to the previous parts to set up a definite integral that represents the volume of the pyramid, then evaluate that integral to find the volume of the pyramid.
           </p>
           </li>
           
            <li>
             <p>
             The volume of a square pyramid is given by the formula <m>V=\frac 1 3 l^2h </m> where <m>l</m> is the side length of the base and <m>h</m> is the height. Use this formula to find the volume of the pyramid and compare to your answer to the previous part.

    <title>The Volume of a Solid of Revolution</title>
    <idx><h>solid of revolution</h></idx>

    <p permid="OxV">
      A solid of revolution is a three dimensional solid that can be generated by revolving one or more curves around a fixed axis.
      For example,
      the circular cone in <xref ref="F-PA-6-2">Figure</xref>
      is the solid of revolution generated by revolving the portion of the line
      <m>y = 3 - \frac{3}{5}x</m> from <m>x = 0</m> to <m>x = 5</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis.
      Notice that if we slice a solid of revolution perpendicular to the axis of revolution,
      the resulting cross-section is a circle.
    </p>

    <p permid="uFe">
      We first consider solids whose slices are thin cylinders.
      Recall that the volume of a cylinder is given by <m>V = \pi r^2 h</m>.

          We slice the solid into vertical slices of thickness

          A representative slice is a cylinder of height

      Often, we will be content with simply finding the integral that represents the volume;

      we typically use a calculator or computer algebra system to find that value.

      <solution permid="Eup">
        <p permid="jwf">
          First, we must determine where the curves
          <m>y = 4-x^2</m> and <m>y = x+2</m> intersect.
          Substituting the expression for <m>y</m> from the second equation into the first equation,
          we find that <m>x + 2 = 4-x^2</m>.

          When we revolve the region <m>R</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis,

          because it has open space in its center along the axis of revolution.
          If we slice the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution,

          At a given location <m>x</m> between <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x = 1</m>,
          the small radius <m>r(x)</m> of the inner circle is determined by the curve <m>y = x+2</m>,
          so <m>r(x) = x+2</m>.
          Similarly, the big radius <m>R(x)</m> comes from the function <m>y = 4-x^2</m>,

            If we revolve about a line other than the <m>x</m>- or <m>y</m>-axis,
            we need to carefully account for the shift that occurs in the radius of a typical slice.
            Normally,
            this shift involves taking a sum or difference of the function along with the constant connected to the equation for the horizontal or vertical line;
            a well-labeled diagram is usually the best way to decide the new expression for the radius.

              To do that, we also need to express <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>,

              Thus we take the given function

              Now, a typical slice has radius
              <m>r(y) = \sqrt[3]{4\arccos \left(\frac{y}{3} \right)}</m> with thickness <m>\triangle y</m>,

              Because we are revolving about <m>y = -1</m>,
              the outer radius is <m>R(x) = 2+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2</m>,

              We slice horizontally and thus the resulting cross-sections are cylinders with thickness <m>\triangle y</m>.
              The radius of the disks changes as <m>y</m> passes through <m>f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{8} = 1.125</m>,
              so we need two different integrals to find the total volume.
              Since we are slicing horizontally,
              we will integrate with respect to <m>y</m>,
              so we  need to solve both of our equations for <m>x</m> as functions of <m>y</m>.
              Observe that <m>y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2 </m> implies <m>2(y-1) = (x-2)^2</m>,
              so <m>x-2 = \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m> and thus <m>x = 2 \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m>,
              and similarly <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> implies <m>x = \pm \sqrt{2y}</m>.
              The portion of the curve defined by
              <m>y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2</m> that determines one of the boundaries is the left hand portion of the parabola,
              so <m>x = 2 - \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m>,
              while the portion of the curve
              <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> that determines the other boundary is the right hand portion of the parabola,
              so <m>x = \sqrt{2y}</m>.
              These two curves define the radius of the disk
              (one for <m>y \lt 1.125</m>, the other for <m>y \gt 1.125</m>)
              and the lowest point on the region is <m>(0,0)</m> while the highest is <m>(0,3)</m>.
              So a sum of integrals that represents the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region <m>R</m> around the <m>y</m>-axis is
