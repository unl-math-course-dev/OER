  <introduction permid="PXA">
    <p permid="HnI">
      Among all functions, linear functions are simplest.
      One of the powerful consequences of a function
      <m>y = f(x)</m> being differentiable at a point <m>(a,f(a))</m> is that,
      up close,
      the function <m>y = f(x)</m> is locally linear and looks like its tangent line at that point.
      In certain circumstances,
      this allows us to approximate the original function <m>f</m> with a simpler function <m>L</m> that is linear:
      this can be advantageous when we have limited information about <m>f</m> or when <m>f</m> is computationally or algebraically complicated.
      We will explore all of these situations in what follows.
    </p>

    <p permid="nuR">
      It is essential to recall that when <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x = a</m>,
      the value of <m>f'(a)</m> provides the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      If we know both a point on the line and the slope of the line we can find the equation of the tangent line and write the equation in point-slope form<fn>
      Recall that a line with slope <m>m</m> that passes through
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> has equation <m>y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)</m>,
      and this is the <em>point-slope form</em> of the equation.

    <title>The tangent line</title>
    <idx><h>tangent line</h><h>equation</h></idx>

    <p permid="TCa">
      Given a function <m>f</m> that is differentiable at <m>x = a</m>,
      we know that we can determine the slope of the tangent line to <m>y = f(x)</m> at
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> by computing <m>f'(a)</m>.
      The equation of the resulting tangent line is given in point-slope form by
      <me permid="pke">
        y - f(a) = f'(a)(x-a) \ \ \text{or} \ \ y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)
      </me>.
      Note well: there is a major difference between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> in this context.
      The former is a constant that results from using the given fixed value of <m>a</m>,
      while the latter is the general expression for the rule that defines the function.
      The same is true for <m>f'(a)</m> and <m>f'(x)</m>:
      we must carefully distinguish between these expressions.
      Each time we find the tangent line,
      we need to evaluate the function and its derivative at a fixed <m>a</m>-value.
    </p>

    <p permid="zJj">
      In <xref ref="F-1-8-TanLine">Figure</xref>,
      we see the graph of a function <m>f</m> and its tangent line at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      Notice how when we zoom in we see the local linearity of <m>f</m> more clearly highlighted.
      The function and its tangent line are nearly indistinguishable up close.
      Local linearity can also be seen dynamically in the java applet at
      <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/6J">http://gvsu.edu/s/6J</url>.

    <p permid="LXB">
      A slight change in perspective and notation will enable us to be more precise in discussing how the tangent line approximates <m>f</m> near <m>x = a</m>.
      By solving for <m>y</m>,
      we can write the equation for the tangent line as
      <me permid="Vrn">
        y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)
      </me>
      This line is itself a function of <m>x</m>.
      Replacing the variable <m>y</m> with the expression <m>L(x)</m>, we call
      <me permid="Byw">
        L(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)
      </me>
      the <em>local linearization of <m>f</m></em>
      at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      In this notation,
      <m>L(x)</m> is nothing more than a new name for the tangent line.
      As we saw above, for <m>x</m> close to <m>a</m>,
      <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <example permid="DJi">
      <statement>
        <p permid="bgz">
          Suppose that a function
          <m>y = f(x)</m> has its tangent line approximation given by
          <m>L(x) = 3 - 2(x-1)</m> at the point <m>(1,3)</m>,
          but we do not know anything else about the function <m>f</m>.
          To estimate a value of <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> near 1, such as <m>f(1.2)</m>,
          we can use the fact that <m>f(1.2) \approx L(1.2)</m> and hence
          <me permid="hFF">
            f(1.2) \approx L(1.2) = 3 - 2(1.2-1) = 3 - 2(0.2) = 2.6
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p permid="seK">
      We emphasize that 
      <m>y = L(x)</m> is simply a new name for the tangent line function.
      Using this new notation and our observation
      that 
      <m>L(x) \approx f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>,
      it follows that we can write

      From <xref ref="act-1-8-1">Example</xref>, we see that
      the local linearization <m>y = L(x)</m> is a linear function that shares two important values with the function
      <m>y = f(x)</m> that it is derived from.
      In particular,

      <ul permid="clS">
        <li permid="NcU">
          because <m>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</m>,
          it follows that <m>L(a) = f(a)</m>; and
        </li>

        <li permid="tkd">
          because <m>L</m> is a linear function,
          its derivative is its slope.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Hence, <m>L'(x) = f'(a)</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
      and specifically <m>L'(a) = f'(a)</m>.
      Therefore, we see that <m>L</m> is a linear function that has both the same value and the same slope as the function <m>f</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.

    <p permid="Etc">
      Thus, if we know the linear approximation <m>y = L(x)</m> for a function,
      we know the original function's value and its slope at the point of tangency.
      What remains unknown, however,
      is the shape of the function <m>f</m> at the point of tangency.

      These possible shapes result from the fact that there are three options for the value of the second derivative:
      either <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m>,
      <m>f''(a) = 0</m>, or <m>f''(a) \gt 0</m>.

      <ul permid="Itb">
        <li permid="Zrm">
          If <m>f''(a) \gt 0</m>,
          then we know the graph of <m>f</m> is concave up,
          and we see the first possibility on the left,
          where the tangent line lies entirely below the curve.
        </li>

        <li permid="Fyv">
          If <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m>,
          then <m>f</m> is concave down and the tangent line lies above the curve,
          as shown in the second figure.
        </li>

        <li permid="lFE">
          If <m>f''(a) = 0</m> and <m>f''</m> changes sign at <m>x = a</m>,
          the concavity of the graph will change,
          and we will see either the third or fourth figure.<fn>
          It is possible that
          <m>f''(a) = 0</m> but <m>f''</m> does not change sign at <m>x = a</m>,
          in which case the graph will look like one of the first two options.
          </fn>.
        </li>

        <li permid="RMN">
          A fifth option (which is not very interesting)
          can occur if the function <m>f</m> itself is linear,

      The plots in <xref ref="F-1-8-Options">Figure</xref>
      highlight yet another important thing that we can learn from the concavity of the graph near the point of tangency:
      whether the tangent line lies above or below the curve itself.
      This is key because it tells us whether or not the tangent line approximation's values will be too large or too small in comparison to the true value of <m>f</m>.
      For instance,
      in the first situation in the leftmost plot in <xref ref="F-1-8-Options">Figure</xref> where <m>f''(a) > 0</m>,
      because the tangent line falls below the curve,
      we know that <m>L(x) \le f(x)</m> for all values of <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>.

      The idea that a differentiable function looks linear and can be well-approximated by a linear function is an important one that finds wide application in calculus.
      For example,
      by approximating a function with its local linearization,
      it is possible to develop an effective algorithm to estimate the zeroes of a function.
      Local linearity also helps us to make further sense of certain challenging limits.
      For instance, we have seen that the limit
      <me permid="tTX">
        \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
      </me>
      is indeterminate,
      because both its numerator and denominator tend to 0.
      While there is no algebra that we can do to simplify <m>\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m>,
      it is straightforward to show that the linearization of
      <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> at the point <m>(0,0)</m> is given by <m>L(x) = x</m>.
      Hence, for values of <m>x</m> near 0, <m>\sin(x) \approx x</m>,
      and therefore
      <me permid="abg">
        \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \approx \frac{x}{x} = 1
      </me>,
      which makes plausible the fact that

            That is,
            a differentiable function looks linear when viewed up close.
            We rename the tangent line to be the function

              we see that <m>f'</m> is increasing approximately on the interval <m>-0.37 \lt x \lt 1.37</m>,
              and thus <m>f</m> is concave up on this interval.

              The tangent line approximation at <m>a = 2</m> is <m>L(x) = f(2) + f'(2)(x-2) \approx 0.0182 + -0.05495(x-2)</m>.
              Thus, <m>f(1.88) \approx L(1.88) \approx 0.0182 + -0.05495(1.88-2) = 0.02479</m>.
              Since <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m> at and around <m>x = 2</m>,
              <m>f</m> is concave down there,
              and therefore the tangent line lies above the curve.
              This makes our estimate larger than the true value of <m>f(1.88)</m>.
