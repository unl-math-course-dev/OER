  <introduction permid="CFP">
  
  <p> 
  Polynomial functions are the simplest possible functions in mathematics,
      in part because they require only addition and multiplication to evaluate. Consequently,  in practical applications, it is often useful to approximate complicated functions using polynomials. In this section we will learn how to obtain polynomial approximations of functions, and how to determine how good an approximation is. 
      </p>
  
  <p>
As an example, consider  the geometric series 
  <men xml:id="E-geomx" permid="PiC">
        1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^k + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x^k
      </men>.
</p>
   
    <p permid="MJv">
      Here we see something very interesting:
      because a geometric series converges whenever its ratio <m>r</m> satisfies <m>|r|\lt 1</m>,
      and the sum of a convergent geometric series is <m>\frac{a}{1-r}</m>,
      we can say that for <m>|x| \lt  1</m>,
      <men xml:id="E-geomxsummed" permid="vpL">
        1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^k + \cdots = \frac{1}{1-x}
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p permid="sQE">
      <xref ref="E-geomxsummed">Equation</xref> states that
      the non-polynomial function
      <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> on the right is equal to the infinite polynomial expresssion on the left.
      Because the terms on the left
      get very small as <m>k</m> gets large,
      we can truncate the series
      and say, for example, that
      <me permid="bwU">
        1 + x + x^2 + x^3 \approx \frac{1}{1-x}
      </me>
      for small values of <m>x</m>.
      This shows one way that a polynomial function can be used to approximate a non-polynomial function;
      such approximations are one of the main themes in this section and the next.
    </p>

    <p permid="YXN">
      In <xref ref="PA-8-5">Example</xref>,
      we begin our exploration of approximating functions with polynomials.
    </p>

<example xml:id="PA-8-5" permid="mNK">
  <statement>
    <p permid="VPz">
      <xref ref="PA-8-3">Example</xref>
      showed how we can approximate the number <m>e</m> using linear,
      quadratic,
      and other polynomial functions;
      we then used similar ideas in <xref ref="PA-8-4">Example</xref> to approximate <m>\ln(2)</m>.
      In this example,
      we review and extend the process to find the <q>best</q>
      quadratic approximation to the exponential function <m>e^x</m> around the origin.
      Let <m>f(x) = e^x</m> throughout this example.

            Find a formula for <m>P_1(x)</m>,
            the linearization of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m>.
            (We label this linearization <m>P_1</m> because it is a first degree polynomial approximation.)
            Recall that <m>P_1(x)</m> is a good approximation to <m>f(x)</m> for values of <m>x</m> close to <m>0</m>.
            Plot <m>f</m> and <m>P_1</m> near <m>x=0</m> to illustrate this fact.

          <p permid="Uam">
            Since <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is not linear,
            the linear approximation eventually is not a very good one.
            To obtain better approximations,
            we want to develop a different approximation that <q>bends</q>
            to make it more closely fit the graph of <m>f</m> near <m>x=0</m>.
            To do so, we  add a quadratic term to <m>P_1(x)</m>.
            In other words, we let
            <me permid="idR">
              P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2x^2
            </me>
            for some real number <m>c_2</m>.
            We need to determine the value  of <m>c_2</m> that makes the graph of <m>P_2(x)</m> best fit the graph of <m>f(x)</m> near <m>x=0</m>.
          </p>

          <p permid="Ahv">
            Remember that <m>P_1(x)</m> was a good linear approximation to <m>f(x)</m> near <m>0</m>;
            this is because <m>P_1(0) = f(0)</m> and <m>P'_1(0) = f'(0)</m>.
            It is therefore reasonable to seek a value of <m>c_2</m> so that

      illustrates the first steps in the process of approximating functions with polynomials.
      Using this process we can approximate trigonometric, exponential,
      logarithmic,
      and other nonpolynomial functions as closely as we like
      (for certain values of <m>x</m>)
      with polynomials.
      This is extraordinarily useful in that it allows us to calculate values of these functions to whatever precision we like using only the operations of addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, and division,
      which can be easily programmed in a computer.

      In the previous section

      we observed that the Taylor polynomials centered at <m>0</m> for <m>e^x</m>,
      <m>\cos(x)</m>,
      and <m>\sin(x)</m> converged to these functions for all values of <m>x</m> in their domain,

      <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> on the interval <m>(-1,1)</m> and diverge for all other values of <m>x</m>.
      So the Taylor series for a function <m>f(x)</m> does not need to converge for all values of <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.

      Our observations suggest two natural questions:

      One question still remains:
      while the Taylor series for <m>e^x</m> converges for all <m>x</m>,
      what we have done does not tell us that this Taylor series actually converges to <m>e^x</m> for each <m>x</m>.

      As we did for power series,
      we define the interval of convergence of a Taylor series  to be the set of values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges.
      And as we did with power series,
      we typically use the Ratio Test to find the values of <m>x</m> for which the Taylor series converges absolutely,
      and then check the endpoints separately if the radius of convergence is finite.

      We now know how to find Taylor polynomials for functions such as <m>\sin(x)</m>,

      This error bound will also allow us to determine whether a Taylor series on its interval of convergence actually equals the function <m>f</m> from which the Taylor series is derived.
      Finally, we will be able to use the error bound to determine the order of the Taylor polynomial <m>P_n(x)</m> that we will ensure that <m>P_n(x)</m> approximates <m>f(x)</m> to the desired degree of accuracy.

              so <m>f'(0) = 3</m>, <m>f''(0) = -4</m>, and <m>f'''(0) = 6</m>.
              In addition, <m>f(0) = -1</m>  Thus,

              Note that this is the same polynomial as <m>f(x)</m>,
              which is not surprising since the degree 3 Taylor polynomial is the degree 3 polynomial that has the same value, slope,
              concavity,
              and third derivative at <m>a = 0</m> as the original.

              We should expect this because all of the higher derivatives

        We explore that idea in more detail in this exercise.
