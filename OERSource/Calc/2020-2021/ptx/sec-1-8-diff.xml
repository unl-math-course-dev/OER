      In this section we aim to determine whether or not the function has a derivative <m>f'(a)</m> at <m>x = a</m>.

    <title>Being Differentiable at a Point</title>
    <idx><h>differentiable</h></idx>

    <p permid="RcT">
      We recall that a function <m>f</m> is said to be differentiable at <m>x = a</m> if <m>f'(a)</m> exists.
      Moreover, for <m>f'(a)</m> to exist,
      we know that the graph of
      <m>y = f(x)</m> must have a tangent line at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>,
      since the value of <m>f'(a)</m> is precisely the slope of this line.
      Observe that in order to ask if <m>f</m> has a tangent line at <m>(a,f(a))</m>,
      it is necessary for <m>f</m> to be continuous at <m>x = a</m>:
      if <m>f</m> fails to have a limit at <m>x = a</m>,
      if <m>f(a)</m> is not defined,
      or if <m>f(a)</m> does not equal the value of <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m>,
      then it doesn't make sense to talk about a tangent line to the curve at this point.
    </p>

    <p permid="xkc">
      Indeed, it can be proved formally that if a function <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x = a</m>,
      then it must be continuous at <m>x = a</m>.
      Stated differently, if <m>f</m> is not continuous at <m>x = a</m>,
      then it is automatically the case that <m>f</m> is not differentiable there.
      For example, in <xref ref="F-1-7-ContDiff">Figure</xref> below,
      both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> fail to be differentiable at <m>x = 1</m> because neither function is continuous at <m>x = 1</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-7-ContDiff">
      <caption>Functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> that are not continuous (and hence not differentiable) at <m>x=1</m>, and a function <m>h</m> that is both continuous and differentiable at <m>x=1</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/1_7_Cont" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="drl">
      A natural question to ask at this point is <q>is there a difference between continuity and differentiability?</q>
      In other words, can a function fail to be differentiable at a point where the function is continuous?
      To answer these questions, we consider a certain function <m>f</m>, where the graph of
      <m>y=f(x)</m> is displayed below in <xref ref="F-1-7-NotDiff">Figure</xref>.
      We notice that <m>f</m> has a sharp corner at the point <m>(1,1)</m>, and
      further observe that <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x=1</m> since <m>\lim_{x\to1} f(x)=1=f(1)</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-7-NotDiff" permid="ibe">
      <caption>A function <m>f</m> that is continuous at <m>x = 1</m> but not differentiable at <m>x = 1</m>; at right, we zoom in on the point <m>(1,1)</m> in a magnified version of the box shown in the left-hand plot.</caption>
      <image width="70%" source="images/1_7_NotDiff" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="Jyu">
      However, the function <m>f</m> in <xref ref="F-1-7-NotDiff">Figure</xref>
      is not differentiable at <m>x = 1</m> because <m>f'(1)</m> fails to exist.
      One way to see this is to observe that
      <m>f'(x) = -1</m> for every value of <m>x</m> that is less than 1, while
      <m>f'(x) = +1</m> for every value of <m>x</m> that is greater than 1.
      That makes it seem that either <m>+1</m> or <m>-1</m> would be equally good candidates for the value of the derivative at <m>x = 1</m>.
      Alternatively,
      we could use the limit definition of the derivative to attempt to compute <m>f'(1)</m>,
      and discover that the derivative does not exist.
      Finally, we can see visually in <xref ref="F-1-7-NotDiff">Figure</xref> that this function does not have a tangent line at <m>x=1</m>.
      Regardless of how closely we examine the function
      by zooming in on <m>(1,1)</m> on the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>,
      it will always look like a <q>V</q>
      and never like a single line,
      which tells us there is no possibility for a tangent line there.
    </p>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Local Linearity</title>
    <p permid="pFD">
      If a function <em>does</em> have a tangent line at a given point,
      then the function and the tangent line should appear essentially indistinguishable
      when we zoom in on the point of tangency.<fn>
      For instance, see
      <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/6J">http://gvsu.edu/s/6J</url> for an applet
      (due to David Austin, GVSU)
      where zooming in shows the increasing similarity between the tangent line and the curve.
      </fn>
      Conversely,
      if we zoom in on a point and the function looks like a single straight line,
      then the function should have a tangent line there
      and thus be differentiable at that point.
<!--
      Hence a function that is differentiable at <m>x = a</m> will,
      up close, look more and more like its tangent line at <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
-->
      Therefore, we say that a function that is differentiable at <m>x = a</m> is
      <term>locally linear</term>.
          <idx><h>locally linear</h></idx>
      An example of this can be seen in <xref ref="F-1-8-local-linearity">Figure</xref> below,
      with the graph of a function <m>y=f(x)</m> on the left and a magnified version with
      the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>a</m> on the right.</p>

<subsection><title>Vertical Tangent Lines</title>

    <p>Another example of when a function can fail to be differentiable at a point <m>x=a</m> is if the function has a vertical tangent at the point. In other words, when <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m> and <m>\lim_{x\to a}|f'(x)|=\infty</m>. This means the tangent lines become very steep as we move closer to <m>x=a</m>. </p>

    <example><p>In this example, let <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m>.</p>
      <p> In <xref ref="F-1-8-vertical-tangent">Figure</xref> below, we have the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> along with a progression of tangent lines at points approaching <m>(0,0)</m> on the graph.
      As we approach <m>x=0</m>, we see that the tangent lines drawn become steeper and steeper, ultimately leading to a vertical tangent line at <m>x=0</m>.</p>
    <figure xml:id="F-1-8-vertical-tangent" permid="fQs">
      <caption>As we move closer to <m>x=0</m>, the tangent lines to the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> become steeper and steeper. Notice that the tangent line closest to <m>x=0</m> is nearly vertical.</caption>
      <image width="75%" source="images/1-8-vertical-tangent.gif" />
    </figure>
      <p>We can also show this by calculating the limit of the derivative close to <m>x=0</m>:
        <me>\lim_{x\to 0}f'(x)=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}=\infty.</me>
