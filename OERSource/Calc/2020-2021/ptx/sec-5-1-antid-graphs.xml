  <introduction permid="joB">
    <p permid="pNH">
      A recurring theme in our discussion of differential calculus has been the question:
      <q>given information about the derivative of an unknown function <m>f</m>,
      how much information can we obtain about <m>f</m> itself?</q>
      In <xref ref="act-1-8-2">Example</xref>,
      the graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m> was known
      (along with the value of <m>f</m> at a single point)
      and we endeavored to sketch a possible graph of <m>f</m> near the known point.
      In <xref ref="Ex-f-from-f-prime">Example</xref>,
      <mdash /> we investigated how the first derivative test enables us to use information about <m>f'</m> to determine where the original function <m>f</m> is increasing and decreasing,
      as well as where <m>f</m> has relative extreme values.
      If we know a formula or graph of <m>f'</m>,
      we can find where the original function <m>f</m> is concave up and concave down by computing <m>f''</m>.
      Thus, knowing <m>f'</m> and <m>f''</m> enables us to understand the shape of the graph of <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="VUQ">
      We returned to this question in even more detail in <xref ref="sec-4-1-velocity-distance">Section</xref>.
      In that setting,
      we knew the instantaneous velocity of a moving object and worked to determine as much as possible about the object's position function.
      We found connections between the net signed area under the velocity function and the corresponding change in position of the function, and
      the Total Change Theorem further illuminated these connections between <m>f'</m> and <m>f</m>,
      showing that the total change in the value of <m>f</m> over an interval <m>[a,b]</m> is determined by the net signed area bounded by <m>f'</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis on the same interval.
    </p>

    <p permid="CbZ">
      In what follows,
      we explore the situation where we possess an accurate graph of the derivative function along with a single value of the function <m>f</m>.
      From that information,
      we'd like to determine a graph of <m>f</m> that shows where <m>f</m> is increasing,
      decreasing, concave up, and concave down,
      and also provides an accurate function value at any point.

    Further, assume that <m>f'</m> is piecewise linear
    (as pictured)

    <title>Constructing the graph of an antiderivative</title>

    <p permid="iji">
      <xref ref="PA-5-1">Example</xref>
      demonstrates that when we can find the exact area under the graph of a function on any given interval,
      it is possible to construct a graph of the function's antiderivative.
      That is, we can find a function whose derivative is given.
      We can now determine not only the overall shape of the antiderivative graph,
      but also the actual <em>height</em>
      of the graph at any point of interest.
    </p>

    <p permid="Oqr">
      This is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
      if we know a function <m>f</m> and the value of the antiderivative <m>F</m> at some starting point <m>a</m>,
      we can determine the value of <m>F(b)</m> via the definite integral.
      Since <m>F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m>, it follows that
      <men xml:id="E-FTCTCT" permid="AWG">

    <title>Multiple antiderivatives of a single function</title>
    <p permid="aEJ">
      In the final question of <xref ref="act-5-1-1">Example</xref>,
      we encountered a very important idea:
      a function <m>f</m> has more than one antiderivative.
      Each antiderivative of <m>f</m> is determined uniquely by its value at a single point.
      For example,
      suppose that <m>f</m> is the function given at left in <xref ref="F-5-1-Ex1">Figure</xref>,
      and suppose further that <m>F</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f</m> that satisfies <m>F(0) = 1</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-5-1-Ex1" permid="XKd">
      <caption>At left, the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.  At right, three different antiderivatives of <m>f</m>.</caption>
      <image width="75%" source="images/5_1_Ex1" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="GLS">
      Then, using <xref ref="E-FTCTCT">Equation</xref>,
      we can compute
      <md permid="hdP">
        <mrow>F(1) &amp;= F(0) + \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= 1 + 0.5</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= 1.5</mrow>
      </md>.
      Similarly, <m>F(2) = 1.5</m>,
      <m>F(3) = -0.5</m>, <m>F(4) = -2</m>,
      <m>F(5) = -0.5</m>, and <m>F(6) = 1</m>.
      In addition,
      we can use the fact that <m>F' = f</m> to ascertain where <m>F</m> is increasing and decreasing,
      concave up and concave down,
      and has relative extremes and inflection points.
      We ultimately find that the graph of <m>F</m> is the one given in blue in <xref ref="F-5-1-Ex1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p permid="mTb">
      If we want an antiderivative <m>G</m> for which <m>G(0) = 3</m>,
      then <m>G</m> will have the exact same shape as <m>F</m>
      (since both share the derivative <m>f</m>),
      but <m>G</m> will be shifted vertically from the graph of <m>F</m>,
      as pictured in red in <xref ref="F-5-1-Ex1">Figure</xref>.
      Note that <m>G(1) - G(0) = \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = 0.5</m>,
      just as <m>F(1) - F(0) = 0.5</m>,
      but since <m>G(0) = 3</m>,
      <m>G(1) = G(0) + 0.5 = 3.5</m>,
      whereas <m>F(1) = 1.5</m>.
      In the same way,
      if we assigned a different initial value to the antiderivative,
      say <m>H(0) = -1</m>, we would get still another antiderivative,
      as shown in magenta in <xref ref="F-5-1-Ex1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Tak">
      This example demonstrates an important fact that holds more generally:
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="qTa">
      <p permid="zht">
        If <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> are both antiderivatives of a function <m>f</m>,
        then the function <m>G - H</m> must be constant.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="foC">
      To see why this result holds,
      observe that if <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> are both antiderivatives of <m>f</m>,
      then <m>G' = f</m> and <m>H' = f</m>.
      Hence,
      <me permid="NkY">
        \frac{d}{dx}[ G(x) - H(x) ] = G'(x) - H'(x) = f(x) - f(x) = 0
      </me>.
      Since the only way a function can have derivative zero is by being a constant function,
      it follows that the function <m>G - H</m> must be constant.
    </p>

    <p permid="LvL">
      We now see that if a function has at least one antiderivative,
      it must have infinitely many:
      we can add any constant of our choice to the antiderivative and get another antiderivative.
      For this reason, we sometimes refer to the
      <em>general antiderivative</em>
          <idx><h>antiderivative</h><h>general</h></idx>
      of a function <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="rCU">
      To identify a particular antiderivative of <m>f</m>,
      we must know a single value of the antiderivative <m>F</m>
      (this value is often called an
      <em>initial condition</em>).
          <idx><h>initial condition</h></idx>
      For example, if <m>f(x) = x^2</m>,
      its general antiderivative is <m>F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C</m>,
      where we include the <q><m>+C</m></q>
      to indicate that <m>F</m> includes <em>all</em>
      of the possible antiderivatives of <m>f</m>.
      If we know that <m>F(2) = 3</m>,
      we substitute 2 for <m>x</m> in <m>F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C</m>,
      and find that
      <me permid="tsh">
        3 = \frac{1}{3}(2)^3 + C
      </me>,
      or <m>C = 3 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{1}{3}</m>.
      Therefore, the particular antiderivative in this case is <m>F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{3}</m>.

              We use the First Fundamental Theorem and areas under the curves to complete the desired table.
              As an example, first note that
              <me permid="Pey">
                B(0) =  \int_{0}^{0} f(t) \, dt = 0
              </me>.
              Then, since the net-signed area between the graph of <m>f</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis on the interval <m>[-1,0]</m> is the area of a square with side lengths of <m>1</m>, we have
              <me permid="vlH">
                B(0) - B(-1) = \int_{-1}^0 f(t) \, dt
              </me>
              and thus <m>B(0) - B(-1) = 1</m>,
              so <m>0 - B(-1) = 1</m> and <m>B(-1) = -1</m>.
              <md permid="nHi">
                <mrow>B(1) &amp;= B(0) + \int_0^1 f(t) \, dt = 0 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2},</mrow>
                <mrow>B(2) &amp;= B(1) + \int_1^2 f(t) \, dt = \frac{1}{2} + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0,</mrow>
                <mrow>B(3) &amp;= B(2) + \int_2^3 f(t) \, dt = 0 + (-1) = -1,</mrow>
                <mrow>B(4) &amp;= B(3) + \int_3^4 f(t) \, dt = -1 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{3}{2},</mrow>
                <mrow>B(5) &amp;= B(4) + \int_4^5 f(t) \, dt = -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = -1,</mrow>
                <mrow>B(6) &amp;= B(5) + \int_5^6 f(t) \, dt = -1 + 1 = 0</mrow>
              </md>.
              We can also say that
              <me permid="bsQ">
                A(x) = \int_{-1}^x f(t) \, dt = \int_{-1}^0 f(t) \, dt + \int_0^x f(t) \, dt = 1+B(x)
              </me>
              and
              <me permid="HzZ">
                C(x) = \int_1^x f(t) \, dt = \int_{0}^x f(t) \, dt - \int_0^1 f(t) \, dt = B(x) - \frac{1}{2}
              </me>.
              This allows us to complete the following table.
