          What are the differences between finding relative extreme values and global extreme values of a function?

          How is the process of finding the global maximum or minimum of a function over the function's entire domain different from determining the global maximum or minimum on a restricted domain?

        <p permid="vJK">
          For a function that is guaranteed to have both a global maximum and global minimum on a closed,
          bounded interval,
          what are the possible points at which these extreme values occur?

      </li>

  <introduction permid="Ymt">
    <p permid="Thb">
      We have seen that we can use the first derivative of a function to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing,
      and the second derivative to know where the function is concave up or concave down.
      This information helps us determine the overall shape and behavior of the graph
      as well as whether the function has relative extrema.
    </p>

    <p permid="zok">
      Remember the difference between a relative maximum and a global maximum:
      there is a <em>relative</em> maximum of <m>f</m> at <m>x = p</m> if
      <m>f(p) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> <em>near</em> <m>p</m>,
      while there is a <em>global</em> maximum at <m>p</m> if
      <m>f(p) \ge f(x)</m> for <em>all</em>
      <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 44%" margins="0%" permid="sfk">
      <p permid="GSJ">
        For instance, in <xref ref="F-3-3-Intro">Figure</xref> at the right,
        we see a function <m>f</m> that has a global maximum at <m>x = c</m> and a relative maximum at <m>x = a</m>,
        since <m>f(c)</m> is greater than or equal to <m>f(x)</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
        while <m>f(a)</m> is only greater than or equal to the value of <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>.
        Since the function appears to decrease without bound,
        <m>f</m> has no global minimum,
        although there is a relative minimum at <m>x = b</m>.
      </p>

    </sidebyside>

		<p permid="fvt">
      When determining global extrema,  the long-run behavior of the function, that is, the behavior of the function as <m>x</m> goes to <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>, must be considered. In many instances, the long run behavior can be determined using basic limit properties. For now, if basic limit properties are not sufficient, determine the long-run behavior by looking at a graph of the function using any online graphing calculator. There are more tools for determining limiting behavior of functions that will be considered in a later section; then visualizing a graph won't be necessary.

<solution>
  <p>
  <ol label="a">
    <li>
    <p>
    We first notice that the domain of <m>f</m> is all real numbers, since the denominator
    of <m>f(x)</m> is always at least <m>1</m>:
    <md>
    <mrow>(x+1)^2\ge\mathstrut\amp0</mrow>
    <mrow>1+(x+1)^2\ge\mathstrut\amp1</mrow>
    </md>.
    To differentiate <m>f</m>, we will first rewrite <m>f(x)</m> as
    <me>f(x)=2+3\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^{-1}</me> and then use the chain rule to find
    <md>
    <mrow>f'(x)=\mathstrut\amp3\left((-1)\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^{-2}\left(2(x+1)(1)\right)\right)</mrow>
    <mrow>=\mathstrut\amp\frac{-6(x+1)}{\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^2}</mrow>
    </md>.
    The denominator of <m>f'(x)</m> is always at least <m>1</m> for the same reason that
    the denominator of <m>f(x)</m> is always at least <m>1</m>, so there are no points
    <m>x=c</m> for which <m>f'(c)</m> does not exist. Thus the only critical number(s) of
    <m>f</m> will occur when <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
    This happens when
    <md>
    <mrow>-6(x+1)=\mathstrut\amp0</mrow>
    <mrow>x+1=\mathstrut\amp0</mrow>
    <mrow>x=\mathstrut\amp-1</mrow>
    </md>.
    Thus the only critical number of <m>f</m> is <m>c=-1</m>, with <m>f'(-1)=0</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    As stated in (a), the denominator of <m>f'(x)</m> is always at least <m>1</m>, so in particular,
    it is always positive.
    On our first derivative sign chart, the only critical number we have is <m>c=-1</m>,
    which splits the domain of <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> into the intervals <m>(-\infty,-1)</m>
    and <m>(-1,\infty)</m>.
    Thinking of the factors of <m>f'(x)</m> as <m>-6</m>, <m>(x+1)</m>, and <m>\frac{1}{\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^2}</m>,
    the signs of these at <m>x=-2</m> are <q><m>--+</m></q>, with the final product positive.
    Likewise, the signs of these factors at <m>x=0</m> are <q><m>-++</m></q>, making the
    final product negative.
    Therefore <m>f'(x)\gt0</m> on the interval <m>x\lt-1</m>, and <m>f'(x)\lt0</m> on the
    interval <m>x\gt-1</m>.
    Hence <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>(-\infty,-1)</m> and decreasing on <m>(-1,\infty)</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    According to the first derivative test, the point <m>(-1,f(-1))</m> is a relative
    maximum of <m>f</m>. Since this is the only critical point of the function and
    <m>f</m> is continuous everywhere, there is nowhere else that <m>f</m> can change
    direction. It follows that this point is actually a global maximum.
    </p>
    <p>
    From an algebraic standpoint, we have already observed that <m>1+(x+1)^2\ge1</m> for every
    value of <m>x</m>. Consequently, <me>0\lt\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le3</me> for every value of
    <m>x</m>, and this quotient achieves its maximum of <m>3</m> when <m>x=-1</m>.
    Hence <me>2\lt2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le5</me> for every value of <m>x</m>.
    Since <m>f(-1)=5</m>, we conclude that the global maximum of <m>f</m> is <m>5</m>
    at <m>x=-1</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    The symmetry of <m>f</m> about <m>x=-1</m> allows us to compute both limits simultaneously.
    We first note that <m>\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)=\infty</m> and
    <m>\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{1}{1+(x+1)^2}=0</m>.
    Thus <me>\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left(2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\right)=2+0=2</me>.
    This tells us the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> has a horizontal asymptote of <m>y=2</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    In (c), we stated the inequality <me>2\lt2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le5</me>. Since the quotient
    in the formula for <m>f(x)</m> is always strictly greater than zero, adding <m>2</m>
    to the quotient to obtain <m>f(x)</m> will always yield a value strictly greater
    than <m>2</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Since <m>f(x)\gt2</m> for every value of <m>x</m>, a global minimum of <m>f</m>
    (if it existed) would necessarily be larger than <m>2</m>. But we showed in (d) that
    <m>\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=2</m>, meaning that <m>f</m> gets arbitrarily close to
    <m>2</m> as <m>x</m> gets large. Moreover, <m>f'</m> is always positive for <m>x\lt-1</m>
    and <m>f'</m> is always negative for <m>x\gt-1</m>, so a lowest point of <m>f</m> is
    never attained.

    <title>Global Optimization</title>
    <p permid="LCC">
      In both <xref ref="F-3-3-Intro">Figure</xref>
      and <xref ref="PA-3-3">Example</xref> above,
      we were interested in finding the global minimum and global maximum for <m>f</m> on its entire domain.
      At other times, we might focus on some restriction of the domain.
    </p>

    <p permid="rJL">
      For example, rather than considering
      <m>f(x) = 2 + \frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
      perhaps instead we are only interested in those <m>x</m> for which <m>0 \le x \le 4</m>,
      and we would like to know which values of <m>x</m> in the interval <m>[0,4]</m> produce the largest possible and smallest possible values of <m>f</m>.
      We are accustomed to critical numbers playing a key role in determining the location of extreme values of a function;
      now, by restricting the domain to an interval
      it makes sense that the endpoints of the interval will also be important to consider,
      as we see in the following example.
      When limiting ourselves to a particular interval,
      we will often refer to the <em>absolute</em>
      maximum or minimum value,
      rather than the <em>global</em> maximum or minimum.

      The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that
      on any closed and bounded interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      a continuous function has to achieve both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum.
      The theorem does not tell us where these extreme values occur,
      only that they must exist.
      As we saw in <xref ref="act-3-3-1">Example</xref>,
      the only possible locations for relative extrema are at the endpoints of the interval or at a critical number.
      It is important to consider only the critical numbers that lie within the interval.

            We first observe that we are working on the domain of all real numbers
            rather than on a closed bounded interval.
            Hence the extreme value theorem does not apply and
            we need to think about the overall behavior of the function.
            First, since <m>f(x) = 4 - e^{-(x-2)^2}</m>,
            we see by the chain rule that <m>f'(x) = -e^{-(x-2)^2}(-2(x-2)) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}</m>.
            Since <m>e^{-(x-2)^2}</m> is always positive
            (and in particular is never zero),
            it follows that the only critical number of <m>f</m> is <m>x = 2</m>.
            Furthermore, with <m>f'(x) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}</m>,

            Thus <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \lt 2</m> and increasing for <m>x \gt 2</m>.
            The first derivative test then tells us that <m>f</m> has an absolute minimum at <m>x = 2</m>
            and <m>f</m> does not have an absolute maximum.

        This will be similar to part (a). We start by differentiating <m>h</m>, finding
        <m>h'(x)=e^{-ax}(1-ax)</m>. Thus the only critical number of <m>h</m> is <m>\frac1a</m>,
        which is on the interval <m>\left[0,\frac2a\right]</m>.
        Evaluating <m>h</m> at the interval endpoints and the critical number, we find
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>

        <m>h\left(\frac1a\right)=\frac1ae^{-1}\approx\frac{0.368}a\gt0</m>

        <li>
        <p>

        </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        Thus on <m>\left[0,\frac2a\right]</m>, the absolute maximum of <m>h</m> is
        <m>\frac1ae^{-1}=(ae)^{-1}</m> and the absolute minimum is <m>0</m>.

        <li>
        <p>
        This is similar to part (d), including the fact that we are looking at all real numbers and not
        a closed bounded domain. We first find that <m>f'(x)=2(x-a)e^{-(x-a)^2}</m> and the only
        critical number of <m>f</m> is <m>x=a</m>.
        Since <m>f'(x)\lt0</m> for <m>x\lt a</m> and <m>f'(x)\gt0</m> for <m>x\gt a</m>,
        the first derivative test tells us that <m>f</m> has a minimum at <m>x=a</m> but has no
        maximum.
        Finally, the value of the absolute minimum is <m>f(a)=b-1</m>.

      The area is maximized when the wire is uncut and all used for the square; the area is minimized
      when approximately <m>11.3</m> cm of wire are used for the triangle and approximately <m>8.7</m> cm

        <p permid="Fdw">
          We begin by sketching a picture that illustrates the situation.
          The variable in the problem is where we decide to cut the wire,
          so we label the cut point at a distance <m>x</m> cm from one end of the wire
          and note that the remaining portion of the wire then has length <m>20-x</m> cm.

          From the <m>x</m> cm segment of wire, we obtain an equilateral triangle with
          three sides of length <m>\frac{x}{3}</m>; the square shaped from the remaining
          <m>20-x</m> cm of wire will have four sides of length <m>\frac{20-x}{4}</m>.

          In the extreme cases,
          all of the wire is being used to make just one figure.
          For instance, if <m>x = 0</m>
          then all 20 cm of wire are used to make a square that is <m>5 \times 5</m>.

        <p permid="xyX">
          Now, our overall goal is to find the minimum and maximum areas that can be enclosed.

      illustrate standard steps that we undertake in almost every applied optimization problem:
      we draw a picture to demonstrate the situation,
      introduce one or more variables to represent quantities that are changing,
      find a function that models the quantity to be optimized,
      and then decide on an appropriate domain for that function.
      Once that is done,
      we are in the familiar situation of finding the absolute minimum and maximum of a function over a particular domain,
