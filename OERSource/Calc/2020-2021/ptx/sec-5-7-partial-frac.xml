  <introduction permid="DDe">
    <p permid="IWR">
      So far, we've learned two integration techniques:
      <m>u</m>-substitution and integration by parts.
      The former is used to reverse the chain rule,
      while the latter is used to reverse the product rule.
      But we have seen that each works only in specialized circumstances.
      For example,
      while <m>\int \frac{2x+4}{x^2+4x+13} \, dx</m> may be evaluated by <m>u</m>-substitution and
      <m>\int x e^x \, dx</m> by integration by parts,
      neither method provides a route to evaluate <m>\int \frac{1}{x^2+4x+13} \, dx</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we'll study two more integration techniques: the method of partial fractions and trigonometric substitution. Before introducing them, we'll walk through an example to help build intuition about the techniques we've already learned, and where they might fall short.

                The third can not be solved using substitution or IBP.

                In fact, one solution to evaluate it involves first using integration by parts then using a method called <xref ref= "PT"> partial fractions</xref>. The fourth integral can be evaluated by using both a substitution and integration by parts. First, perform the substitution <m> w=1+x^2 \ , dw= 2x \, dx </m> which transforms the integral to <m> \frac{1}{2} \int \ln(w) \, dw </m>.

    <title>The Method of Partial Fractions</title>
    <idx><h>partial fractions</h></idx>
    
    <p permid="Vlj">
      The method of partial fractions is used to integrate rational functions, 
     which are functions that can we written as a quotient of polynomials. 
      
      </p>
      
    <p>
      For example, the function <m> f(x) = \frac{1}{x(x-1)} </m> is the quotient of the polynomial funtions <m> p(x) = 1 </m> and <m> q(x)=x(x-1) </m>. While it is not immediately clear how to compute <m> \int \frac{1}{x(x-1)} \, dx </m> as written, it turns out that a simple algebraic maneuver will make the task much simpler. In particular, before attempting to integrate we rewrite the integrand as  
      
      <me>
        \frac{1}{x(x-1)} = \frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{x-1}
      </me>.
      
      One can check that this equality holds by finding a common denominator for the right-hand side and simplifying. The integral can then be calculated as
      
      <me>
      \int \frac{1}{x(x-1)}dx= \int\frac{1}{x}dx - \int \frac{1}{x-1}dx = \ln|x|-\ln|x-1|+C
      </me>.
      
      The expression <m> \frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{x-1}</m> is a <term>partial fraction decomposition</term> of <m> \frac{1}{x(x-1)} </m>. 
      
      </p>
      
      <p>
      A partial fraction decomposition can be thought of as reversing the process of finding a common denominator. 
      Thus, the method is applicable when the denominator of a rational function can be factored into smaller degree polynomials. In the examples that follow, we'll demonstrate how to find more complicated partial fraction decompositions and use them to integrate rational functions.

          If we factor the denominator of the integrand,

          <men xml:id="E-PF-1" permid="pNU">

          Multiplying both sides of this equation by the denominator of the left hand side, <m>(x-2)(x+1)</m>,

          Notice that if this equation is going to hold, then the coefficients for <m> x </m> on each side of the equation need to match, and we need the constant terms on each side of the equation to match. This gives us the following system of equations:

          We find that <m> A=\frac{10}{3} </m> and <m> B=\frac{5}{3} </m>.

          If we factor the denominator of the integrand, we can see that <m> \frac{2x^2+5}{x^3-2x^2+x} = \frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2} </m>. Notice that the factor <m> (x-1)</m> shows up twice in the denominator. We call <m> (x-1)^2 </m> a repeated linear root. The repeated linear root slightly changes our partial fraction decomposition. <m> \frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2} </m> can be decomposed into the sum of fractions <m> \frac{A}{x}+ \frac{B}{x-1}+\frac{C}{(x-1)^2}</m>. We need both <m> \frac{B}{x-1} </m> and <m> \frac{C}{(x-1)^2} </m> since both <m> x-1 </m> and <m> (x-1)^2 </m> divide <m> x(x-1)^2 </m>. Suppose

          Multiplying both sides of this equation by the denominator of the left hand side, <m> x(x-1)^2 </m>, we find that

          Like the previous example, we need the coefficients for <m> x^2 </m> to be the same on each side of the equation, the coeffiecients for <m> x </m> to be the same on each side of the equation, and the constant terms to be the same on each side of the equation. Thus, we obtain the system of equations

          The denominator of the integrand is already factored, and the quadratic polynomial <m> x^2 + 2x + 3 </m> cannot be factored anymore. We call this factor an irreducible quadratic factor. The irreducible quadratic factor slightly changes our partial fraction decomposition. <m> \frac{3x^2-1}{(x^2+2x+3)(x-2)} </m> can be decomposed into the sum of fractions <m> \frac{Ax+B}{x^2+2x+3}+ \frac{C}{x-2}</m>. We need the term <m> \frac{Ax+B}{x^2+2x+3} </m> to include all possibilities where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Suppose

          Like the first example, we need the coefficients for <m> x^2 </m> to be the same on each side of the equation, the coeffiecients for <m> x </m> to be the same on each side of the equation, and the constant terms to be the same on each side of the equation. Thus, we obtain the system of equations
          <me> A+C=3 \ , -2A+B-2C=0 \ , \text{ and } -2B+3C=-1.</me>
          We find that <m> A=2 </m>, <m> B=2 </m>, and <m> C=1 </m>. Thus, using <xref ref="E-PF-3"> Equation </xref>, we can rewrite the original integral as 
          <me>\int \frac{3x^2-1}{(x^2+2x+3)(x-2)} \, dx=\int  \frac{2x+2}{x^2+2x+3}  + \frac{1}{x-2} \, dx</me>
          
          This integral can be evaluated by using the fact that <m> \int \frac{1}{u} \, du =\ln|u|+C</m> and by using appropriate substitutions, and hence we find that

          Before decomposing the integrand into partial fractions, we need to perform polynomial long division because the degree of the numerator, <m> 3</m>, is greater than the degree of the denominator, <m> 2</m>. We need to do this because partial fraction decompsition leads to a sum of rational functions where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. 
          
        </p>
        
        <p> After completing polynomial long division, we find that   
          <me> 
            \frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2}
            = 3x + \frac{7-3x}{-x^2+3x-2} \, ,
          </me>
          hence, we can change the original integral
          <men xml:id="E-PF-4"> 
            \int \frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx
            = \int 3x \, dx + \int \frac{7-3x}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx
          </men>  
          We'll proceed by using the method of partial fraction decomposition on the integrand <m> \frac{7-3x}{-x^2+3x-2} </m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the denominator factors as <m> -x^2+3x-2= (x-1)(2-x) </m>, so we'll suppose the integrand decomposes as
          <me> \frac{7-3x}{(x-1)(2-x)}= \frac{A}{x-1}+ \frac{B}{2-x}</me>
          
          and we'll look for constants <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator of the left hand side, <m> (x-1)(2-x)</m>, we find that 
          <me> 7-3x = A(2-x) + B(x-1) </me>
          
          To find <m> A</m> and <m> B</m>, we will rearrange the right hand side of the equation so that similar terms are grouped.

            <mrow> 7-3x&amp;=(B-A)x+(2A-B)</mrow>
          </md>
          To make sure the coefficients of <m> x</m> match on each side of the equation and that the constant terms are the same on each side of the equation, we obtain the following system of equations: 
          <me> -3=B-A \text{ and } 7=2A-B</me>
          
          We find that <m> A=4 </m> and <m> B=1 </m>. Thus, using <xref ref="E-PF-4"> Equation </xref>, we can rewrite the original integral as 
          <md>
            <mrow> \int \frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx

          </md> 
          These integrals can be evaluated by using the antidifferentiation rules from <xref ref="T-4-4-Act2_2"> Table </xref> and using appropriate substitutions, and hence we find that 
          <md>

      Now that we've seen some examples, we give a general description of the method of partial fractions. 
      
      <assemblage>
        <title> Method of Partial Fraction Decomposition for a Rational Function <m> R(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} </m> </title>
        <p> 
          Note: This method works best on rational functions when <m> Q(x)</m> can be factored into linear and irreducible quadratic terms. 
          <ul> 
            <li>
              <p> If the degree of <m> P(x) </m> is greater than or equal to the degree <m> Q(x) </m>, then perform polynomial long division to calculate <m> \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}</m>, else move on to the next step. The result gives a new way to write <m>R(x)</m>. We know that <m> R(x)= S(x)+ \frac{P_2(x)}{Q(x)} </m> where <m> S(x) </m> is the quotient of the polynomial long division and <m> P_2 (x) </m> is the remainder of the polynomial long division. Now the degree of <m> P_2(x) </m> is less than the degree of <m> Q(x) </m>, so follow the remaining steps to decompose <m> \frac{P_2(x)}{Q(x)}</m> . </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> If the degree of <m> P(x) </m> is less than the degree of <m> Q(x)</m>, then factor <m> Q(x) </m> and add a partial fraction for the decomposition based on the following rules: 
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p> For each distinct linear factor <m> (x-c)</m> of <m> Q(x) </m>, add 
                      <me> \frac{A}{x-c}.</me>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p> For each repeated linear factor <m> (x-c)^n</m> of <m> Q(x)</m> where <m> n </m> is a positive whole number, add 
                      <me> \frac{A_1}{x-c} + \frac{A_2}{(x-c)^2} + \cdots + \frac{A_n}{(x-c)^n}.</me>
                    </p>  
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                    <p> For each irreducible quadratic factor <m> t(x) </m> of <m> Q(x) </m>, add 
                      <me> \frac{Ax+B}{t(x)}. </me>
                    </p>  
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                    <p> For each repeated irreducible quadratic factor <m> t(x)^n </m> of <m> Q(x) </m> where <m> n </m> is a positive whole number, add 
                      <me> \frac{A_1x+B_1}{t(x)} + \frac{A_2x+B_2}{t(x)^2} + \cdots + \frac{A_nx+B_n}{t(x)^n}.</me>
                    </p>  
                  </li> 
                </ul>  
                
                Now algebraically solve for the value of the constants <m>A_1, A_2,..., B_1, B_2,...</m> and integrate each piece separately.
              </p>
            </li>  
          </ul>  
        </p>
      </assemblage>  
    </p> 
    <p>
      The smaller blocks that <m> R(x) </m> is broken into often lead to more manageable antidifferentiation.
      For example if <m> A </m> and <m> k </m> are real numbers, then <m> \int \frac{A}{x-k} \, dx = A \ln |x-k| + C</m> by using the substitution <m> u=x-k </m>. 
      We also know the antiderivative of other common partial fractions like <m> \int \frac{A}{x^2+1} \, dx= A \arctan(x) + C </m>.

              <p>
                First, use polynomial long division since the degree of the numerator is the same as the degree of the denominator. We'll find that 
                <me>\frac{4x^2+x}{2x^2+x-1} = 2 + \frac{2-x}{2x^2+x-1}.</me>
                To use partial fraction decomposition on the remainder, we'll assume that 
                <me> \frac{2-x}{2x^2+x-1}=\frac{2-x}{(2x-1)(x+1)}=\frac{A}{2x-1}+ \frac{B}{x+1}</me>
                To solve for <m> A </m> and <m> B</m>, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator of the left side of the equation and rearrange like the earlier exmaples. We'll have the following sequence of steps: 
                <md> 
                  <mrow> 2-x&amp;=A(x+1) + B(2x-1) </mrow>

                </md>
                We know that 
                <me> A+2B=-1 \, \text{ and } A-B=2, </me>
                so <m> A=1 </m> and <m>B=-1</m>. This implies that

      In <xref ref="sec-5-5-substitution">Section</xref>, we saw that certain integrals could be simplified considerably by making a <m> u </m>-substitution. Here, we'll see an extension of this idea that will allow us to compute some integrals which don't immediately appear amenable to traditional substitutions. Making a substitution of the form <m> x=\sin(\theta) </m> or <m> x=\tan(\theta) </m> and applying of one of the following trigonometric identities will be our <em> modus operandi </em>.

      First, let's look at the substitution <m> x=\sin(\theta) </m> where <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m> <fn> <xref ref="E-TS-1"> Example </xref> will show why we need these bounds on <m> \theta </m> </fn> to see how it can be used to find the indefinite integral <m>\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx</m>. 
      <example xml:id="E-TS-1">
        <p> 
          Use the substitution <m>x=\sin(\theta) </m> where <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m> to find the general antiderivative 
          <me>\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\, dx.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          When using the substitution <m> x=\sin(\theta) </m> where <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m>, we are regarding <m> x </m> as a function of <m> \theta </m>. The goal is to change the integrand to contain trigonometric functions so that the Pythagorean Identity can be used. To do this, the integral will be changed to be in terms of the variable <m> \theta</m>. With this in mind, both <m> x </m> and <m> dx </m> will need to be changed. Starting from <m> x=\sin(\theta) </m>, take the derivative with respect to <m> \theta </m> to find that 
          <me> \frac{dx}{d\theta}=\cos(\theta) .</me>
          In other words, <m> dx=\cos(\theta) \, d\theta </m>. Now, change the original integral to be in terms of the variable <m> \theta </m>: 
          <me> \int\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\, dx=\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta  </me>
          Use the Pythagorean Identity, <m>1-\sin^2(\theta)=\cos^2(\theta)</m> to simplify the denominator of the integrand:
          <me> \int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta = \int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}} \, d \theta.</me>
          Now we need to use the assumption that <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. In general, <m>\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=|\cos(\theta)|</m>, but <m>\cos(\theta)\geq 0</m> on the interval <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. Thus, <m> |\cos(\theta)|=\cos(\theta)</m> if <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m>. The denominator can now be further simplified, and the remaining steps lead to a familar integral: 
          <md>
            <mrow>\int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta \amp = \int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{|\cos(\theta)|} \, d\theta </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =\int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} \, d\theta </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =\int 1 \, d\theta </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =\theta + C</mrow>
          </md>   
          While we have computed an antiderivative successfully, we aren't quite done yet because the answer is not written in terms of the original variable <m> x </m>. Rearrange the substitution equation <m>x=\sin(\theta) </m> to find that <m> \theta=\arcsin(x) </m> and use this to turn <m> \theta</m> back into a function of <m> x </m>. Therefore, 
          <me> \int\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx= \arcsin(x) + C </me>
        </p>
      </example> 
    </p>
    <p>
      From now on, we'll usually omit the explanation that <m> \sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=|\cos(\theta)|=\cos(\theta)</m> since we additionally assume that <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m> in order to force <m> \cos(\theta) \geq 0 </m>. It is still incredibly important so that the calculation of the antiderivative is seamless, but since we always assume that <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m> the same reasoning always applies. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The substitution demonstrated in the previous example can be generalized to situations in which the integrand contains <m> a^2-x^2 </m>, where <m> a </m> is a real number and <m> x </m> is a variable. In this case, setting <m> x = a\sin(\theta) </m> results in the simplification <m> a^{2}-x^{2} = a^{2}(1-\sin^{2}(\theta))=a^{2}\cos^{2}(\theta) </m>.

                  It is worth noting that the curve <m> y = \sqrt{16-x^{2}} </m> for <m>0 \leq x \leq 4 </m> is the part of the circle of radius <m> 4 </m> centered at the origin which lies in the first quadrant of the plane. The definite integral <m> \int_{0}^{4} \sqrt{16-x^{2}} \,dx </m> thus gives the area of the part of this circle which lies in the first quadrant. Since the circle in question has total area <m> 16 \pi </m> and the portion in the first quadrant compirese precisely <m> 1/4 </m> of the total area, we are assured our solution of <m> 4\pi </m> is correct.

      We summarize the substitution <m> x = a \sin(\theta) </m> below.
    </p>
    <assemblage> <title>Trigonometric Substitution: <m> u=a\sin(\theta) </m></title> 
      <p>
        The substitution <m> u=a\sin(\theta) </m> where <m> u </m> is some function of <m> x </m>, <m> a </m> is a real number, and <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m> is often helpful when the integrand contains an expression of the form <m> a^2-u^2 </m>. When this substitution is used, then <m> u^2=a^2\sin^2(\theta)</m> and after factoring out <m> a^2 </m>, the Pythagorean Identity <fn><m>1-\sin^2(\theta)=\cos^2(\theta) </m> </fn> can be used to simplify part of the integrand: 
        <me> a^2-u^2=a^2-a^2\sin^2(\theta)=a^2(1-\sin^2(\theta))=a^2\cos^2(\theta) </me>.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Since we assumed <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} </m>, then <m> \cos (\theta) \geq 0 </m>. This implies that <m> \sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=|\cos(\theta)|=\cos(\theta) </m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    
    <p>
      Another important trigonometric substitution is <m> x=\tan(\theta) </m> where <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} &lt; \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. This substitution can be used to show that <m> \int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx= \arctan(x) + C </m>.

        </answer>
        <solution>
        <p>
          When using the substitution <m> x=\tan(\theta) </m> where <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} &lt; \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2} </m>, we are regarding <m> x </m> as a function of <m> \theta </m>. The goal is to change the integrand to contain trigonometric functions so that a modified version of the Pythagorean Identity can be used. The version of the Pythagorean Identity we will use when simplifying after a tangent substitution is <m>\tan^2(\theta) + 1 =\sec^2(\theta) </m>. To achieve this goal, the integral will be changed to be in terms of the variable <m> \theta</m>. With this in mind, both <m> x </m> and <m> dx </m> will need to be changed. Starting from <m> x=\tan(\theta) </m>, take the derivative with respect to <m> \theta </m> to find that 
          <me> \frac{dx}{d\theta}=\sec^2(\theta) .</me>
          In other words, <m> dx=\sec^2(\theta) \, d\theta </m>. Now, change the original integral to be in terms of the variable <m> \theta </m>: 
          <me> \int\frac{1}{1+x^2}\, dx=\int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{1+\tan^2(\theta)} \, d\theta  </me>
          Use a modified version of the Pythagorean Identity, <m>1+\tan^2(\theta)=\sec^2(\theta)</m> to simplify the denominator of the integrand:
          <me> \int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{1+\tan^2(\theta)} \, d\theta = \int\frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{\sec^2(\theta)} \, d \theta.</me>
          The integrand can now be further simplified, and the remaining steps lead to a familar antiderivative: 
          <md>
            <mrow> \int\frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{\sec^2(\theta)} \, d \theta&amp;= \int 1 \, d \theta</mrow>
            <mrow> &amp;=\theta + C</mrow>
          </md>   
          While we have computed an antiderivative successfully, we aren't quite done yet because the answer is not written in terms of the original variable <m> x </m>. Rearrange the substitution equation <m>x=\tan(\theta) </m> to find that <m> \theta=\arctan(x) </m> and use this to turn <m> \theta</m> back into a function of <m> x </m>. Therefore, 
          <me> \int\frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx= \arctan(x) + C </me>

      Just as the substition <m> x = a\sin(\theta) </m> can be useful when <m> a^{2}-x^{2} </m> appears in the integrand, <m> x = a \tan(\theta) </m> may be the right substitution when dealing with terms involving <m> a^{2}+x^{2} </m>. The following examples will explore this idea.

                Set <m> x=2\tan(\theta) </m>, so that <m> dx=2\sec^2(\theta) d\theta</m>. Since <m> x^{2}=4\tan^{2}(\theta) </m>, we get

                Since <m> \tan(\theta)=\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} </m> and <m> \sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} </m>, we have
                 <me>

                 </me>
                 The integral <m> \frac{1}{4}\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin^{2}(\theta)}\, d\theta </m> can be evaluated via yet another substitution---this time, a <m>u</m>-substitution in which we set <m> u = \sin(\theta). </m> Then <m> du = \cos(\theta) d\theta </m>. Finally,

                </md>
                Substituting back for <m> u </m>, we reach <m> -\frac{1}{4u} = -\frac{1}{4\sin(\theta)}=-\frac{\csc(\theta)}{4} </m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, one may establish a right triangle relating the angle <m> \theta </m> and the variable <m> x </m>, just as in <xref ref="E-TS-2">Example</xref>. Doing this yields <m> \sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{4+x^{2}}} </m>, and thus <m>-\frac{\csc(\theta)}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{4+x^{2}}}{4x}.</m> We conclude <m> \int \frac{1}{x^{2}\sqrt{4 + x^{2}}} \, dx = -\frac{\sqrt{4+x^{2}}}{4x}+C.</m>

The substitution <m> 3x=5\tan(\theta) </m> will allow us to use the modified Pythagorean Identity. Then <m> (3x)^2=25\tan^2(\theta)</m> and <m> dx=\frac{5}{3} \sec^2(\theta) d\theta </m>. The original integral can be transformed using this substitution: 
                <md> 
                  <mrow>\int \frac{3x}{\sqrt{25+9x^2}} \, dx &amp;= \frac{5}{3}\int \frac{5\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25+25\tan^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta </mrow>

                </md>
                We must be careful at this step when we simplify <m>\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}</m>. Because we chose <m> -\frac{\pi}{2} &lt; \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2} </m>, then <m>\sec^2(\theta) \geq 1 \geq 0 </m>. Notice that if we had picked a different interval for <m> \theta </m>, <m>\sec(\theta) </m> could be negative and then we would have to introduce an absolute value in order for the square root to be defined. Since we know <m> \sec^2(\theta) \geq 1\geq 0</m> on the interval of <m> \theta</m> we care about then <m> \sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}=\sec(\theta)</m>. Therefore, the integral simplifies further:
