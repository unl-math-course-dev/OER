  <introduction permid="trh">


    <p permid="NTS">
      We are now accustomed to investigating the behavior of a function by examining its derivative.
      
    </p>

    <p permid="ubb">
      Because <m>f'</m> is itself a function,
      it is perfectly feasible for us to consider the derivative of the derivative,
      which is the new function <m>y = [f'(x)]'</m>.
      We call this resulting function
      <em>the second derivative of <m>f</m>,</em>
<!--          <idx><h>second derivative</h></idx> -->
<!--      of <m>y = f(x)</m>,-->
      and denote the second derivative by <m>y = f''(x)</m>.
      Consequently,
      we will sometimes call <m>f'</m>
      <q>the first derivative</q> of <m>f</m>,
      rather than simply <q>the derivative</q> of <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="MeF">
    <idx><h>second derivative</h><h>definition</h></idx>
    <assemblage permid="AVG">
    <title>Second Derivative</title>
        <p>
          The <term>second derivative</term>
          is the derivative of the first derivative.
          That is,
          <me permid="olP">
            f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left[f'(x)\right]
          </me>.
          We read <q><m>f''(x)</m></q> as <q><m>f</m>-double prime of <m>x</m></q>,
          or as <q>the second derivative of <m>f</m></q>.
        </p>
    </assemblage>
    </p>

    <p permid="aik">
      The meaning of the derivative function still holds,
      so when we compute <m>f''(x)</m>,
      this new function measures slopes of tangent lines to the curve <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      as well as the instantaneous rate of change of <m>y = f'(x)</m>.
      In other words,
      just as the first derivative measures the rate at which the original function changes,
      the <em>second</em> derivative measures the rate at which the <em>first</em> derivative changes.
      The second derivative will help us understand how the rate of change of the original function is itself changing.
    </p>
 <example>
 <statement>
    <p permid="xUF">
Consider the function <m>f(x)=x^5-3x^4+x</m>. The derivative is:
            <me permid="mqU">
f'(x)=5x^4-12x^3+1.
</me>
This creates a new function whose derivative can also be found:
            <me permid="mqU">
f''(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\left[5x^4-12x^3+1\right]=20x^3-36x^2.
</me>
</p>
</statement>
</example>
 <example>
 <statement>
    <p permid="xUF">
Consider the function <m>g(x)=3(x^3+4x+2)^7</m>. To find the derivative we must use the chain rule. The derivative is:
            <me permid="mqU">
g'(x)=21(x^3+4x+2)^6(3x^2+4).
</me>
To take the second derivative, first we must use the product rule:
            <me permid="mqU">
g''(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\left[21(x^3+4x+2)^6(3x^2+4)\right]=\frac{d}{dx}\left[21(x^3+4x+2)^6\right](3x^2+4)+21(x^3+4x+2)^6\frac{d}{dx}\left[(3x^2+4)\right]
</me>
The derivative of the first term requires using the chain rule again:
            <me permid="mqU">
g''(x)=126(x^3+4x+3)^5(3x^2+4)(3x^2+4)+21(x^3+4x+3)^6(6x).
</me>
Note that the term <m>(3x^2+4)</m> appears twice, once for each derivative, both are the derivative of the inside function.

<subsection><title>Acceleration</title><p>
If the function <m>s(t)</m> gives the position of an object at time <m>t</m> then <m>s'(t)</m> gives the change in position, otherwise known as velocity.  
That is, <m>s'(t)=v(t)</m>, where <m>v(t)</m> is the velocity function.  
Using the alternate notation, we have <m>\displaystyle \frac{ds}{dt}=v(t)</m>.
</p> 

<p>Following this same idea, <m>v'(t)</m> gives the change in velocity, more commonly called acceleration.  
Using derivative notation, <m>v'(t)=a(t)</m>.  Therefore, <m>s''(t)=a(t)</m>.  
That is, the second derivative of the position function gives acceleration.  
Using the alternative notation, we write <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}=a(t)</m>.



<fn>
Notice that in higher order derivatives the exponent occurs in what appear to be different locations in the numerator and denominator.  
In reality, what is happening is we have <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^{n}}{dt^{n}}</m> acting as an operator that takes the <m>n</m>th order derivative of the function. </fn>


</p>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Suppose that an object is launched from a height of 12 feet with an initial velocity of 15 feet per second. We can describe the position of the object with the following function: <me> s(t)=-16^2+15t+12.</me>
<ol label="a">
<li> Find an equation for the velocity of the object; make sure to include units.</li>
<li> Find an equation for the acceleration of the object; make sure to include units.</li>
</ol>
</p>

</statement>

<answer>
<p>
<ol label="a">
<li> <m>v(t)=-32t+15 </m> feet per second.</li>
<li> <m>a(t)=-32</m> feet per second per second (or <m>ft/s^2</m>).</li>
</ol>
</p>
</answer>


<solution>
<p>
<ol label="a">
<li> The velocity is the derivative of position:
<me>v(t)=s'(t)=-32t+15.</me>
The units of velocity are feet per second. 
</li>

<li> The acceleration is the derivative of velocity or the second derivative of position:
<me>a(t)=v'(t)=s''(t)=-32.</me>
The units are feet per second per second, often written as <m>ft/s^2</m>. 
Here the acceleration due to gravity is <em>constant</em>, typically in physics acceleration due to gravity is taken as <m>-32ft/s^2</m>. This is negative since gravity pulls an object down. If we are working in the metric system then gravity is given as <m>-9.8m/s^2</m>.

<subsection><title>Higher Order Derivatives</title><p>
We have seen that when we take the derivative of a function a new function <m>f'(x)</m> is created. We took the derivative of this new function to get the second derivative. We can repeat this process as many times as we wish.</p>
<p>
The <em>third derivative of a function <m>f(x)</m> </em> is the derivative of the second derivative, written as <m>f'''(x)</m> or more commonly as <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^3f}{dx^3}</m>.
</p>
<p>
The <em>fourth derivative of a function <m>f(x)</m> </em> is the derivative of the third derivative, written as <m>f^{(4)}(x)</m> or more commonly as <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^4f}{dx^4}</m>.
</p>
<p> We can continue to take derivatives in this way.</p>

</example>
<p>
Two notes from <xref ref="heigher-1">Example</xref>:</p>
<p> 1) In <xref ref="heigher-1">Example</xref> any further derivatives would end as 0 since the derivative of a constant is 0. This is true of any polynomial, eventually if you take enough derivatives they will end as 0.</p>
<p> 2) For a polynomial as you take more derivatives the function becomes simpler.</p>


<example xml:id="heigher-2" permid="vLx">
 <statement>
    <p permid="xUF">
Consider the function <m>\displaystyle g(x)=\frac{1}{x}</m>, find the <m>4^{th}</m> derivative of <m>g(x)</m>. </p>

The second derivative is:

</me>
The third derivative is:
            <me permid="mqU">
g'''(x)=-6x^{-4}=\frac{-6}{x^4}.
</me>
The fourth derivative is:
            <me permid="mqU">
g^{(4)}(x)=24x^{-5}=\frac{24}{x^5}.
</me>

</p>
</statement>
</example>
<p> Note that unlike the polynomial in <xref ref="heigher-1">Example</xref>, the function in <xref ref="heigher-2">Example</xref> has as many derivatives as we like. They never go to 0!</p>

 <example>
 <statement>
    <p permid="xUF">
Consider the function <m>h(t)=\sqrt{t^2+4}</m>, find the <m>3rd</m> derivative of <m>h(t)</m>. </p>
<p> Start with the first derivative of <m>h(t)</m>; in this case will have to use the chain rule:
            <me permid="mqU">
\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}(t^2+4)^{-1/2}(2t)
</me>
To find the second derivative, we need to use both product rule and chain rule:
            <me permid="mqU">
\frac{d^2h}{dt^2}=\frac{-1}{4}(t^2+4)^{-3/2}(2t)(2t)+\frac{1}{2}(t^2+4)^{-1/2}(2)=(t^2+4)^{-3/2}(-t^2)+(t^2+4)^{-1/2}.
</me>
To take the third derivative, we will have to use the product rule on the first term and the chain twice:
            <me permid="mqU">
\frac{d^3h}{dt^3}=\frac{-3}{2}(t^2+4)^{-5/2}(2t)(-t^2)+(t^2+4)^{-3/2}(-2t)+\frac{-1}{2}(t^2+4)^{-3/2}(2t)
</me>

</p>
</statement>
</example>
<p>Note that when you take higher order derivatives involving the chain rule you must be very careful to keep track of every term. </p>

              Observe that <m>g'</m> is always positive.
              This tells us that <m>g</m> must be always increasing.
              Therefore, it follows that <m>g</m> may cross the <m>x</m>-axis at most one time,

              Whenever <m>g'</m> is increasing, <m>g''</m> is positive,
              and whenever <m>g'</m> is decreasing, <m>g''</m> is negative.
              Hence, whenever <m>g'</m> changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa,
