<introduction>

<p permid="riI"> Limits are a mathematical construct we can use to describe the behavior of a function near a point.

Why might we want to consider the behavior near a point instead of at the point?

Consider the function <m>\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{x^2-25}{x-5}</m>. The domain of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>x\neq 5</m>, that is the domain is all <m>x</m> not equal to <m>5</m>. Thus we can say that <m>f(5)</m> does not exists (DNE). Since we can not plug in <m>x=5</m>, we will instead seek to understand what happens to <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer, but not equal to, <m>5</m>. We can try to answer this question by simply plugging in values of <m>x</m> that are getting closer and closer to <m>5</m> into <m>f(x)</m>, see <xref ref="table-1-F-1-1-Ex1g">Table </xref>.

Observe that as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer, but not equal to <m>5</m>, the function values are getting closer and closer to <m>10</m>.

</p>
<p permid="tTK">

Instead of filling out a table of values, we could instead look at the graph of a function and ask the same question. What happens to the function as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer, but not equal to, a particular value? Consider the function <m>g</m> given by the graph in

<xref ref="F-1-1-PA1">Figure </xref> below. We can evaluate the function at a variety of points. For example, <m>g(-2)=0</m>, <m>g(-1)=3</m>, and <m>g(0)=1</m>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="F-1-1-PA1" permid="Dxa">
<caption>Graph of <m>y = g(x)</m>.</caption>
<image width="47%" source="images/1_2_PA1" />
</figure>
<p>

A careful look at the graph above shows that <m>g(x)</m> has a hole (or a removable discontinuity) at <m>x=0</m>, making <m>g(0)=1</m> even though the overall shape of the graph might lead us to expect <m>g(0)</m> to be <m>4</m>. In fact, you would probably agree that <q>as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer (but NOT equal) to <m>0</m>, <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to <m>4</m>.</q>

</p>
<p permid="tTK">

Both of these examples demonstrate the idea of a limit; that is, both ask the question: what happens to the function as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer, but not equal to, a particular value?</p>

</introduction>



<subsection permid="BTI">

<title>The Notion of Limit</title>

<p permid="NMB"> Limits give us a way to identify a trend in the values of a function as its input variable approaches a particular value of interest.

We need a precise understanding of what it means to say

<q>a function <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>.</q>

</p>



<p permid="tTK">

In <xref ref="F-1-1-PA1">Figure</xref>,

we saw that

as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer

(but NOT equal)

to 0, <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to the value 4.

At first, this may feel counter-intuitive,

because the value of <m>g(0)</m> is <m>1</m>, not <m>4</m>.

Limits describe the behavior of a function

<em>arbitrarily close to</em> a fixed input

and are not affected by the value of the function <em>at</em>

the fixed input.

<!-- TODO: Check this <fn> tag when I actually have internet, or find a way to make it work -->

More formally,<fn>

What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit.

To be completely precise,

it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say

<q>as close to <m>L</m> as we like</q>

and <q>sufficiently close to <m>a</m>.</q>

That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.

That being said, the definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.
        
        </p>
  

</fn> we say the following.

</p>







<assemblage permid="upj"><title>Limit of a Function</title>



<p permid="kzY">

If a function <m>f</m> is defined on an interval around <m>c</m>, except perhaps at the point <m>x = c</m>, we define the <term>limit of the function <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></term> to be a number <m>L</m> (if one exists) such that <m>f(x)</m> is as close to <m>L</m> as we want whenever <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>c</m> (but <m>x \neq c</m>). If <m>L</m> exists, we write <me>\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L</me>.





On the other hand, if as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> we cannot make <m>f(x)</m> as close to a single value as we would like,

then we say that <term><m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></term>.

</p>

</assemblage>



<p permid="aaT">

For any function <m>f</m>,

there are typically three ways to answer the question

<q>does <m>f</m> have a limit at <m>x = a</m>, and if so,

what is the limit?</q>



<ol label="1" permid="DIV">

<li permid="NcH">

Create a table to look at values that approach <m>a</m> on either side

(typically using some sort of computing technology),

and ask if they seem to approach a single value, as we did in the first example in the introduction.

</li>



<li permid="tjQ">

Look at the graph of the function and see what value the function is approaching as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> on either side.

</li>

<li permid="tjQ">

Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach <m>a</m>.

</li>

</ol>



The first approach can be tedious and should only be used for functions that you can not use the second two approaches. If you can write a computer program to do this then it can be a very useful approach.



</p>



<example permid="aws">

<statement>

<p permid="QHh">

Recall the function <m>g</m> from the section introduction, whose graph is reproduced below.

<figure xml:id="F-1-2-PA1prime" permid="Dxa">

<caption>Graph of <m>y = g(x)</m></caption>

<image width="47%" source="images/1_2_PA1" />

</figure>

For the function <m>g</m> pictured in <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1prime">Figure</xref>,

we make the following observations:

<me permid="juF">

\lim_{x \to -1} g(x) = 3, \ \lim_{x \to 0} g(x) = 4, \ \text{and} \ \lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = 1

</me>.

When finding a limit from a graph,

it suffices to ask if the function <em>approaches</em>

a single value from each side of the fixed input.

The function value <em>at</em> the fixed input is irrelevant.

This reasoning explains the values of the three limits stated above.

</p>



<p permid="wOq">

We further observe that <m>g</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m>

because there is a jump in the graph at <m>x = 1</m>.

If we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the left,

the function values tend to get close to 3,

but if we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the right,

the function values get close to 2.

There is no single number that all of these function values approach.

This is why the limit of <m>g</m> does not exist at <m>x = 1</m>.

</p>

</statement>

</example>



<example permid="aws">

<statement>

<p permid="QHh">

Consider the function <m>f(x)</m> graphed below.

<figure xml:id="F-1-3-PA1prime" permid="Dxa">

<caption>Graph of <m>y =f(x)</m></caption>

<image width="47%" source="images/limits1.png" />

</figure>

For the function <m>f</m> pictured in <xref ref="F-1-3-PA1prime">Figure</xref>,

we make the following observations:

<me permid="juF">

\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = 3, \ \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 1, \ \lim_{x \to 3}f(x)=-1, \text{and} \ \lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = -0.5

</me>.

When finding a limit from a graph,

it suffices to ask if the function <em>approaches</em>

a single value from each side of the fixed input.

The function value <em>at</em> the fixed input is irrelevant. Thus, the limit to <m>-1</m> is <m>3</m> even though <m>f(-1)=4</m> (where the filled in dot is), and the limit to <m>3</m> is <m>-1</m> even though <m>f(3)=DNE</m>.

This reasoning explains the values of the four limits stated above.

</p>



<p permid="wOq">

We further observe that <m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m>

because there is a jump in the graph at <m>x = 1</m>.

the function values tend to get close to <m>-1</m>,

but if we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the right,

the function values get close to 0.
