    <p permid="hdC">
      In <xref ref="PA-4-1">Example</xref>,
      we learned that
      when the velocity of a moving object is constant
      (and positive),
      the area under the velocity curve over an interval of time tells us the distance the object traveled.
    </p>

      <caption>At left, a constant velocity function; at right, a non-constant velocity function.</caption>
      <image width="74%" source="images/4_1_VelArea" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="NkL">
      The left-hand graph of <xref ref="F-4-1-VelArea">Figure</xref>
      shows the velocity of an object moving at 2 miles per hour over the time interval <m>[1,1.5]</m>.
      The area <m>A_1</m> of the shaded region under <m>y = v(t)</m> on <m>[1,1.5]</m> is
      <me permid="hNw">
        A_1= 2 \, \frac{\text{miles} }{\text{hour} } \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hours}  = 1 \, \text{mile}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="trU">
      This result is due to the formula for area of a rectangle, but it is also simply the fact that distance equals rate times time,
      provided the rate is constant.
      Thus, if <m>v(t)</m> is constant on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      the distance traveled on <m>[a,b]</m> is equal to the area <m>A</m> given by
      <me permid="NUF">
        A = v(a) (b-a) = v(a) \Delta t
      </me>,
      where <m>\Delta t</m> is the change in <m>t</m> over the interval.
      Since the velocity is constant,
      we can use any value of <m>v(t)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      we simply chose <m>v(a)</m>,
      the value at the interval's left endpoint.
      For several examples where the velocity function is piecewise constant, see
      <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/9T">http://gvsu.edu/s/9T</url>.<fn>
      Marc Renault, calculus applets.
      </fn></p>

    <p permid="Zzd">
      The situation is more complicated when the velocity function is not constant.
      On relatively small intervals where <m>v(t)</m> does not vary much,
      we can use 
      the area principle to estimate the distance traveled.
      The right-hand graph of <xref ref="F-4-1-VelArea">Figure</xref>
      shows a non-constant velocity function.
      On the interval <m>[1,1.5]</m>, the
      velocity varies from <m>v(1) = 2.5</m> down to <m>v(1.5) \approx 2.1</m>.
      One estimate for the distance traveled is the area of the pictured rectangle,
      <me permid="ubO">
        A_2 = v(1) \Delta t = 2.5 \, \frac{\text{miles} }{\text{hour} } \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hours}  = 1.25 \, \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="FGm">
      Note that because <m>v</m> is decreasing on <m>[1,1.5]</m>,
      <m>A_2 = 1.25</m> is an over-estimate of the actual distance traveled.
    </p>
    <!--<sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%" valign="bottom">-->
    <p permid="lNv">
      To estimate the area under this non-constant velocity function on a wider interval,
      say <m>[0,3]</m>, one rectangle will not give a good approximation.
      Instead, we could use the six rectangles pictured in <xref ref="F-4-1-VelArea2">Figure</xref>,
      find the area of each rectangle, and add up the total.
      Obviously there are choices to make and issues to understand:
      How many rectangles should we use?
      Where should we evaluate the function to decide the rectangle's height?
      What happens if the velocity is sometimes negative?
      Can we find the exact area under any non-constant curve?
    </p>

    </figure>
<!--</sidebyside>-->
    <p permid="RUE">
      We will study these questions and more in what follows;
      for now it suffices to observe that the simple idea of the area of a rectangle gives us a powerful tool for estimating distance traveled from a velocity function,
      as well as for estimating the area under an arbitrary curve.
      To explore the use of multiple rectangles to approximate area under a non-constant velocity function,

    <title>When velocity is negative</title>
   
    <p permid="TJR">
      Consider a simple example where a woman goes for a walk on the beach along a stretch of very straight shoreline that runs east-west.
      We assume that her initial position is <m>s(0) = 0</m>,
      and that her position function increases as she moves east from her starting location.
      For instance,
      <m>s = 1</m> mile represents one mile east of the start location,
      while <m>s = -1</m> tells us she is one mile west of where she began walking on the beach.
    </p>

    <p permid="zRa">
      Now suppose she walks in the following manner.
      From the outset at <m>t = 0</m>,
      she walks due east at a constant rate of <m>3</m> mph for 1.5 hours.
      After 1.5 hours,
      she stops abruptly and begins walking due west at a constant rate of <m>4</m> mph and does so for 0.5 hours.
      Then, after another abrupt stop and start,
      she resumes walking at a constant rate of <m>3</m> mph to the east for one more hour.
      What is the total distance she traveled on the time interval from <m>t = 0</m> to <m>t = 3</m>?
      What the total change in her position over that time?
    </p>

    <p permid="fYj">
      These questions are possible to answer without calculus because the velocity is constant on each interval.
      From <m>t = 0</m> to <m>t = 1.5</m>, she traveled
      <me permid="mxp">
        D_{[0,1.5]} = 3 \ \text{miles per hour}  \cdot 1.5 \ \text{hours}  = 4.5 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Mfs">
      On <m>t = 1.5</m> to <m>t = 2</m>,
      the distance traveled is
      <me permid="SEy">
        D_{[1.5,2]} = 4 \ \text{miles per hour}  \cdot 0.5 \ \text{hours}  = 2 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="smB">
      Finally, in the last hour she walked
      <me permid="yLH">
        D_{[2,3]} = 3 \ \text{miles per hour}  \cdot 1 \ \text{hours}  = 3 \ \text{miles}
      </me>,
      so the total distance she traveled is
      <me permid="eSQ">
        D = D_{[0,1.5]} + D_{[1.5,2]} + D_{[2,3]} = 4.5 + 2 + 3 = 9.5 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="YtK">
      Since the velocity for <m>1.5 \lt  t \lt  2</m> is <m>v = -4</m>,
      indicating motion in the westward direction,
      the woman first walked 4.5 miles east,
      then 2 miles west, followed by 3 more miles east.
      Thus, the total change in her position is
      <me permid="KZZ">
        \text{change in position}  = 4.5 - 2 + 3 = 5.5 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="EAT">
      We have been able to answer these questions fairly easily,
      and if we think about the problem graphically,
      we can generalize our solution to the more complicated setting when velocity is not constant,
      and possibly negative.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-4-1-NegVel" permid="prV">
      <caption>At left, the velocity function of the person walking; at right, the corresponding position function.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/4_1_NegVel" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="kIc">
      In <xref ref="F-4-1-NegVel">Figure</xref>,
      we see how the distances we computed can be viewed as areas:
      <m>A_1 = 4.5</m> comes from multiplying rate times time (<m>3 \cdot 1.5</m>),
      as do <m>A_2</m> and <m>A_3</m>.
      But while <m>A_2</m> is an area
      (and is therefore positive),
      because the velocity function is negative for <m>1.5 \lt t \lt 2</m>,
      this area has a negative sign associated with it.
      The negative area distinguishes between <em> distance traveled </em> and <em> change in position </em>. 
    </p>

    <p permid="QPl">
      The distance traveled is the sum of the areas,
      <me permid="rhi">
        D = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 4.5 + 2 + 3 = 9.5 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="wWu">
      But the change in position has to account for travel in the negative direction.  
      An area above the <m>t</m>-axis is considered positive because it represents distance traveled in the positive direction,
      while one below the <m>t</m>-axis is viewed as negative because it represents travel in the negative direction.
      Thus, the change in the woman's position is
      <me permid="Xor">
        s(3) - s(0) = (+4.5) + (-2) + (+3) = 5.5 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
      In other words,
      the woman walks 4.5 miles in the positive direction,
      followed by 2 miles in the negative direction,
      and then 3 more miles in the positive direction.
    </p>

    <p permid="ddD">
      Negative velocity is also seen in the graph of the position function <m>y=s(t)</m>.
      Its slope is negative (specifically,
      <m>-4</m>) on the interval
      <m>1.5\lt t\lt 2</m> because the velocity is <m>-4</m> on that interval.
      The negative slope shows the position function is decreasing because the woman is walking east,
      rather than west.
    </p>

    <p permid="JkM">
      To summarize: we see that if velocity is sometimes negative,
      a moving object's change in position different from its distance traveled.
      If we compute separately the distance traveled on each interval where velocity is positive or negative,
      we can calculate either the total distance traveled or the total change in position.
      We assign a negative value to distances traveled in the negative direction when we calculate change in position,
      but a positive value when we calculate the total distance traveled.

<subsection><title>Left and Right Hand Sums</title>
<p>At this point we have used rectangles to estimate the total area underneath a curve.  We will now explore a couple of different ways of constructing these rectangles.  Consider the figures below.  In <xref ref="F-4-1-LH">Figure</xref> the rectangles are formed by setting the height of the rectangle so that the left side of the rectangle touches the curve. Conversely, in <xref ref="F-4-1-RH">Figure</xref> the right side of the rectangle touches the curve.  These are commonly called left hand approximations and right hand approximations respectively.

You could similarly note that in <xref ref="F-4-1-RH">Figure</xref> the right hand approximation gives an overestimate for the total area under the curve.

    <title>Sigma Notation</title>
    <p permid="Tos">
      We have used sums of areas of rectangles to approximate the area under a curve.
      Intuitively,
      we expect that using a larger number of thinner rectangles will provide a better estimate for the area.
      Consequently,
      we anticipate dealing with sums of a large number of terms.
      To do so, we introduce <em>sigma notation</em>,
          <idx><h>sigma notation</h></idx>
      named for the Greek letter <m>\Sigma</m>,
      which is the capital letter <m>S</m> in the Greek alphabet.
    </p>

    <p permid="zvB">
      For example, say we are interested in the sum
      <me permid="Afv">
        1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100
      </me>,
      i.e. the sum of the first 100 natural numbers.
      In sigma notation, we write
      <me permid="gmE">
        \sum_{k=1}^{100} k =  1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="fCK">
      We read the symbol <m>\sum_{k=1}^{100} k</m> as
      <q>the sum from <m>k</m> equals 1 to 100 of <m>k</m>.</q>
      The variable <m>k</m> is called the index of summation,
      and any letter can be used for this variable.
      The pattern in the terms of the sum is denoted by a function of the index;
      for example,
      <me permid="MtN">
        \sum_{k=1}^{10} (k^2 + 2k) =  (1^2 + 2\cdot 1) + (2^2 + 2\cdot 2) + (3^2 + 2\cdot 3) + \cdots + (10^2 + 2\cdot 10)
      </me>,
      and more generally,
      <me permid="sAW">
        \sum_{k=1}^n f(k) = f(1) + f(2) + \cdots + f(n)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="LJT">
      Sigma notation allows us to vary easily the function being used to describe the terms in the sum,
      and to adjust the number of terms in the sum simply by changing the value of <m>n</m>.
      We test our understanding of this new notation in the following example.
    </p>

<example xml:id="act-4-2-1" permid="chk">
  <statement>
    <p permid="SNy">
      For each sum written in sigma notation,
      write the sum long-hand and evaluate the sum to find its value.
      For each sum written in expanded form,
      write the sum in sigma notation.

      When a moving body has a positive velocity function
      <m>y = v(t)</m> on a given interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      the area under the curve over the interval gives the total distance the body travels on <m>[a,b]</m>.
      We are also interested in finding the exact area bounded by
      <m>y = f(x)</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      regardless of the meaning or context of the function <m>f</m>.
      For now, we continue to focus on finding an accurate estimate of this area by using a sum of the areas of rectangles.
      Unless otherwise indicated,
      we assume that <m>f</m> is continuous and non-negative on <m>[a,b]</m>.

      Thus, we have two variables to explore:
      the number of rectangles and the height of each rectangle.
      We can explore these choices dynamically,
      and the applet<fn>
      Marc Renault, Geogebra Calculus Applets.
      </fn> found at
      <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/a9">http://gvsu.edu/s/a9</url>
      is a particularly useful one.
      There we see the image shown in <xref ref="F-4-2-RenaultAppletRS">Figure</xref>,
      but with the opportunity to adjust the slider bars for the heights and the number of rectangles.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p permid="tGp">
      By moving the sliders,
      we can see how the heights of the rectangles change as we consider left endpoints,
      midpoints, and right endpoints,
      as well as the impact that a larger number of narrower rectangles has on the approximation of the exact area bounded by the function and the horizontal axis.
    </p>

    <p permid="ZNy">
      When <m>f(x) \ge 0</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      each of the Riemann sums <m>L_n</m>, <m>R_n</m>,
      and <m>M_n</m> provides an estimate of the area under the curve
      <m>y = f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
      We also recall that in the context of a nonnegative velocity function <m>y = v(t)</m>,
      the corresponding Riemann sums approximate the distance traveled on <m>[a,b]</m> by a moving object with velocity function <m>v</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="FUH">
      There is a more general way to think of Riemann sums,
      and that is to allow any choice of where the function is evaluated to determine the rectangle heights.
      Rather than saying we'll always choose left endpoints,
      or always choose midpoints,
      we simply say that a point
      <m>x_{i+1}^*</m> will be selected at random in the interval <m>[x_i, x_{i+1}]</m>
      (so that <m>x_i \le x_{i+1}^* \le x_{i+1}</m>).
      The Riemann sum is then given by
      <me permid="pGq">
        f(x_1^*) \cdot \Delta x + f(x_2^*) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{i+1}^*) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_n^*) \cdot \Delta x = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x

    <p permid="mbQ">
      At <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/a9">http://gvsu.edu/s/a9</url>,
      the applet noted earlier and referenced in <xref ref="F-4-2-RenaultAppletRS">Figure</xref>,
      by unchecking the <q>relative</q> box at the top left,
      and instead checking <q>random,</q>
      we can easily explore the effect of using random point locations in subintervals on a Riemann sum.
      In computational practice, we most often use <m>L_n</m>,

    <title>When the function is sometimes negative</title>
    <p permid="qLJ">
      For a Riemann sum such as
      <me permid="VNz">
        L_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \Delta x
      </me>,
      we can of course compute the sum even when <m>f</m> takes on negative values.
      We know that when <m>f</m> is positive on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      a Riemann sum estimates the area bounded between <m>f</m> and the horizontal axis over the interval.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-4-2-NegF" permid="bCL">
      <caption>At left and center, two left Riemann sums for a function <m>f</m> that is sometimes negative; at right, the areas bounded by <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,d]</m>.</caption>

    <p permid="WSS">
      For the function pictured in the first graph of <xref ref="F-4-2-NegF">Figure</xref>,
      a left Riemann sum with 12 subintervals over <m>[a,d]</m> is shown.
      The function is negative on the interval <m>b \le x \le c</m>,
      so at the four left endpoints that fall in <m>[b,c]</m>,
      the terms <m>f(x_i) \Delta x</m> are negative.
      This means that those four terms in the Riemann sum produce an estimate of the <em>opposite</em>
      of the area bounded by <m>y = f(x)</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis on <m>[b,c]</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Dab">
      In the middle graph of <xref ref="F-4-2-NegF">Figure</xref>,
      we see that by increasing the number of rectangles the approximation of the area
      (or the opposite of the area)
      bounded by the curve appears to improve.
    </p>

    <p permid="jhk">
      In general,
      any Riemann sum of a continuous function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> approximates the difference between the area that lies above the horizontal axis on <m>[a,b]</m> and under <m>f</m> and the area that lies below the horizontal axis on <m>[a,b]</m> and above <m>f</m>.
      In the notation of <xref ref="F-4-2-NegF">Figure</xref>,
      we may say that
      <me permid="BUI">
        L_{24} \approx A_1 - A_2 + A_3
      </me>,
      where <m>L_{24}</m> is the left Riemann sum using 24 subintervals shown in the middle graph.
      <m>A_1</m> and <m>A_3</m> are the areas of the regions where <m>f</m> is positive,
      and <m>A_2</m> is the area where <m>f</m> is negative.
      We will call the quantity <m>A_1 - A_2 + A_3</m> the
      <em>net signed area</em>
          <idx><h>net signed area</h></idx>
      bounded by <m>f</m> over the interval <m>[a,d]</m>,
      where by the phrase <q>signed area</q>
      we indicate that we are attaching a minus sign to the areas of regions that fall below the horizontal axis.
    </p>

    <p permid="vvC">
      Finally, we recall that if the function <m>f</m> represents the velocity of a moving object,
      the sum of the areas bounded by the curve tells us the total distance traveled over the relevant time interval,
      while the net signed area bounded by the curve computes the object's change in position on the interval.

 <p permid="Wxt">
      In <xref ref="F-4-3-IncreaseN">Figure</xref>,
      we see evidence that increasing the number of rectangles in a Riemann sum improves the accuracy of the approximation of the net signed area bounded by the given function.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-4-3-IncreaseN" permid="iLL">
      <caption>At left and center, two left Riemann sums for a function <m>f</m> that is sometimes negative; at right, the exact areas bounded by <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,d]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/4_2_NegF" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="CEC">
      We therefore explore the natural idea of allowing the number of rectangles to increase without bound.
      In an effort to compute the exact net signed area we also consider the differences among left, right,
      and middle Riemann sums and the different results they generate as the value of <m>n</m> increases.
      We begin with functions that are exclusively positive on the interval under consideration.
    </p>


    <p permid="OSU">
      In <xref ref="F-4-3-IncreaseN">Figure</xref>,
      we saw that as the number of rectangles got larger and larger,
      the values of <m>L_n</m> converge to some value.
      It turns out that any continuous function on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>, <m>L_n</m> and <m>R_n</m> will converge to the same value as <m>n</m> grows larger.
     In fact, for any continuous function and a Riemann sum using any point
      <m>x_{i+1}^*</m> in the interval <m>[x_i, x_{i+1}]</m>, <m>\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x</m> will converge to that same value.
      Thus, as we let <m>n \to \infty</m>,
      it doesn't really matter where we choose to evaluate the function within a given subinterval, because
      <me permid="MIi">
        \lim_{n \to \infty} L_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} R_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} M_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x
      </me>.

    <p permid="vad">
      The fact that these limits always exist
      (and share the same value)
      when <m>f</m> is continuous<fn>
      It turns out that a function need not be continuous in order to have a definite integral.
      For our purposes,
      we assume that the functions we consider are continuous on the interval(s) of interest.
      It is straightforward to see that any function that is piecewise continuous on an interval of interest will also have a well-defined definite integral.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <ul>

 <li>
          <p>
If we know the velocity of a moving object at every point in a given interval, then we can determine the distance the object has traveled on that time interval by finding the area under the velocity function on that interval. We can also determine the position of the object by taking into account that the position function is decreasing when the velocity is negative. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
When we cannot compute the area under the velocity curve exactly, we can use rectangles to estimate the area. The heights of the rectangles are determined by the values of the velocity function, and we must make a choice of what values we use, such as the left endpoint, the right endpoint, the midpoint, etc. We then find the sum of the areas of the rectangles, called a <em> Riemann sum </em>, and this is our estimate for the net signed area under the curve. 

</p> 
</li>



<li> 
<p>

Often we will use <em> sigma notation </em> when writing out the sum that we obtain from adding up the areas of the rectangles. For example, if we want to compute <m> L_n </m>, then using sigma notation we can write <m>
        L_n = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \Delta x
      </m>, where <m> x_i </m> is the left endpoint of the <m> i+1 </m> rectangle, as seen in <xref ref="F-4-2-LeftSum">Figure</xref>. 

</p>
</li>

<li>
          <p>
The more rectangles we use, the more accurate our estimate will be. In fact, if we continue to increase the number of intervals and take the limit of these estimates, we obtain the exact area, called the <em> definite integral </em>. Notationally, this is given by  <me permid="sPr">
            \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x

              We observe that <m>v(t) = 0</m> at <m>t = 0</m>,

              The total change in position,

              Using computational technology,

              We find that <m>M_{25} = 2.6496</m>,

              Since it appears that neither of the first two decimal places are changing as we increase the number of subintervals,
              it looks like <m>P = \int_0^4 v(t) \, dt \approx 2.665</m> is accurate to two decimal places.

              From experimenting with different <m>n</m>-values in <m>M_n</m>,
              it is apparent that each of these individual estimates is accurate to at least <m>3</m> decimal places,

              Hence,

                D = \int_0^1 v(t) \, dt - \int_1^3 v(t) \, dt + \int_3^4 v(t) \, dt \approx 0.41669 - (-2.6668) + 4.91667 = 8.00016

              Therefore <m>D \approx 8.00016</m> is an estimate of distance traveled accurate to at least <m>2</m> decimal places.

              Since the area between the velocity function and the <m>t</m>-axis tells us distance traveled

              For the total distance traveled, <m>D</m>,
              we take the opposite of the change in position on any interval where the velocity is negative.

              Recall that the average value of a function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> is
              <me permid="wFi">
                f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) dx
              </me>.
              So the average velocity,
              <m>AV</m>, of the object on the interval <m>[0,4]</m> is
              <me permid="cMr">
                AV = \frac{1}{4} \int_0^4 v(t) \, dt = (0.25)(-2.625) = -0.65625

              Assuming that <m>v</m> is linear on the interval <m>[0,1.5]</m>,
              the slope of <m>v</m> is <m>-\frac{3}{1.5} = -2</m>.
              Given that the <m>v</m>-intercept is <m>(0,1)</m> we conclude that on the interval <m>[0,1.5]</m> we have <m>v(t) = -2t+1</m>.
              Now position,
              <m>s</m>, is an antiderivative of the velocity, <m>v</m>,
              so the possible formulas for <m>s</m> on the interval <m>[0,1.5]</m> are <m>s(t) = -t^2+t+C</m>,
              where <m>C</m> is some constant.
              If we want <m>s(0) = 0</m>,
              that forces <m>C=0</m> and so the object's position function on <m>[0, 1.5]</m> that satisfies
              <m>s(0) = 0</m> is <m>s(t) = -t^2+t</m>.
