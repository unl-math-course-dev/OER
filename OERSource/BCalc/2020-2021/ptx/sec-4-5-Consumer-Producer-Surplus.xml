<introduction>
<p>
It is of interest to both consumers and producers to know the best <em>price</em> to buy or sell a product. Let us consider the demand curve, <m>p=D(x)</m>, the price per unit that a consumer is willing to pay for <m>x</m> units of a product, and the supply curve, <m>p=S(x)</m>, the price per unit that the producer is willing to accept for the sale of <m>x</m> units.
 </p>
<p> 
As the number of units <m>x</m> that are produced and sold increases, the demand curve, <m>D(x)</m> decreases. This is because consumers expect to pay less per unit for large quantities of the product. At a small scale, you can see this anytime you visit the grocery store: the price per unit when you buy a single item is almost always much more than the price per item when you buy in bulk. Graphically, <m>D(x)</m> is represented as a decreasing function. 
</p>
<p>
As the number of units <m>x</m>  that are produced and sold increases, the supply curve, <m>S(x)</m> increases. This is because a higher price per unit sold is an incentive for the producer to make more units available for sale. Graphically, <m>S(x)</m> is represented by an increasing function. The <em>equilibrium point (Q,P)</em> is the point at which the supply meets demand, or the point of intersection of the curves <m>S(x)=D(x)</m>.

<title>Consumer and Producer Surplus</title>


    <p permid="vYs">
     Some consumers are willing to spend more on a product than the equilibrium price. The total difference between the equilibrium price of an item and the higher price a consumer is willing to spend is call the <em> Consumer Surplus</em> at the equilibrium and is the area between the curves <m>D(x)</m> and the horizontal line <m>y=P</m>, the equilibrium price (see <xref ref="F-4-5-1">Figure </xref>).
</p>
<p>
Similarly, some producers are willing to sell a product at a price lower than the equilibrium price. The total difference between the equilibrium price of the item and lower price producers are willing to accept is called the <em> Producer Surplus</em> at the equilibrium. This is also an area between two curves: the horizontal line <m>y=P</m> and the supply curve, <m>S(x)</m>, (see <xref ref="F-4-5-1">Figure </xref>).
</p>
    <figure xml:id="F-4-5-1" permid="SlM">
    <caption>Graphs of the Supply and Demand Curves</caption>

    </figure>
<p>
In Section 4.4 we saw that the area between two curves, <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>, can be determined by the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_a^b \left(f(x)-g(x)\right)dx</m>, where <m>g(x)</m> has y-values below <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. TSince the producer and consumer surpluses are represented by areas between two curves, then we can use integration to calculate these values.

      <title>Consumer Producer Surplus</title>
      <p>
 Let <m>p=D(x)</m> describe the demand function for a product and <m>p=S(x)</m> be the supply function for the same product. The equilibrium point <m>(Q,P)</m> is the point where <m>D(x)=S(x)</m>. 
</p>
<p>
The Consumer Surplus at the equilibrium point is:

<me>
\int\limits_0^Q \left(D(x)-P\right) dx=\int\limits_0^Q D(x) dx-QP
</me>

</p>
<p>
The Producer Surplus at the equilibrium point is:

<me>
\int\limits_0^Q \left(P-S(x)\right) dx=QP-\int\limits_0^Q S(x) dx
</me>

</p>

    </assemblage>
    </p>

<example xml:id="example-one">
  <statement>
    <p>
Suppose the supply function for selling <m>x</m> units is given by the equation <m>\displaystyle S(x)=250+5x</m>; the demand function for <m>x</m> units is given by <m>\displaystyle D(x)=1000-10x</m>. Find the producer and consumer surplus and explain what they represent.
    </p>
<p>
<em> Solution:</em> The first step is to find the equilibrium quantity, <m>Q</m>. To do this we set <m>S(x)=D(x)</m> and solve for <m>x</m>:
<me> 250+5x=1000-10x \implies 15x=750 \implies x=50</me>
That is the equilibrium quantity is <m>Q=50</m> units sold.
</p>
<p>
Next find the equilibrium price, <m>P</m> by plugging in <m>x=50</m> into either <m>S(x)</m> or <m>D(x)</m>.
<me> S(50)=250+5(50)=500
</me> 
And
<me> D(50)=1000-10(50) = 500.</me>
Thus the equilibrium price is <m>P=\$500</m>. 
</p>
<p> The consumer surplus is
<me>
\int\limits_0^Q \left(D(x)-P\right)dx=\int\limits_0^{50} \left(1000-10x-500\right)dx=\int\limits_0^{50} \left(500-10x\right)dx
</me>
<me>
=\left.\left(500x-\frac{10x^2}{2}\right)\right|_0^{50}=\left(500(50)-5(50)^2)\right)-0=\$12500
</me>
Thus the advantage to the consumer who buys at the equilibrium price is <m>\$12,500</m>.
</p>
<p>
The Producer Surplus is
<me>
\int\limits_0^Q \left(P-S(x)\right)dx=\int\limits_0^{50} \left(500-(250+5x)\right)dx=\int\limits_0^{50}\left(250-5x\right)dx
</me>
<me>
=\left.\left(250x-\frac{5x^2}{2}\right)\right|_0^{50}=\left(250(50)-\frac{5(50)^2}{2}\right)-0=\$6250
</me>
This means that the producer will have additional income of <m>\$6,250</m> if they sell their product at the equilibrium price.

      2(x-15)(x+30)=0.

If we let <m> p = D(x) </m> be the demand curve and <m> p = S(x) </m> be the supply curve, then the <em> equilibrium point  </em> is the point <m> (Q, P) </m>  at which the supply meets demand; in other words, where <m> S(x) = D(x) </m>. 
</p>
</li>

<li> 
<p> 
The <em> consumer surplus  </em> is the difference between the equilibrium price of an item and the higher price that a consumer is willing to spend. This is also the area between the curves <m> D(x) </m> and the horizontal line <m> y=P </m>. We can use integration to calculate this area, so the consumer surplus at the equilibrium point is <m> \int_0^Q D(x)dx - QP </m>. 
</p>
</li>

<li> 
<p> 
The <em> producer surplus  </em> is the difference between the equilibrium price of an item and the lower price at which a producer is willing to sell that item. This is also the area between the curves <m> S(x) </m> and the horizontal line <m> y=P </m>. As with the consumer surplus, we can use integration to calculate this area, so the producer surplus at the equilibrium point is <m>QP -  \int_0^Q S(x)dx  </m>.
