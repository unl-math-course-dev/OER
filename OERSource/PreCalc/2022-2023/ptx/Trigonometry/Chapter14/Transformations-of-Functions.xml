<title>Transformations of Functions</title>

<p>
	It is often useful to consider trigonometric functions after we have applied function transformations to them. In this section we review function transformations and their effects on the equations and graphs of trigonometric functions. </p>

    <p>If you would like to review function transformations in more depth, you can refer to <xref ref="chap5" >Function Transformations</xref>.</p>


	<subsection><title>Vertical Function Transformations</title>
	<p></p>

       <p> There are many situations (which we will see in later sections) where it is useful to consider functions such as <m>j(x) = 2\sin(\pi(x-1))+3</m>. We will work our way up to this function, but first let's start by exploring a simpler function, <m> g(x) = 2\sin(x)</m>. If we want to determine what the graph of <m>g(x)</m> looks like, we can start by finding a few points on the graph using a table.</p>

<p> From the table, we observe that multiplying the sine function by <m> 2 </m> results in all of the outputs of the function being multiplied by <m>2</m>. This results in a <term> vertical stretch </term> of <m> \sin(x) </m> by a factor of <m> 2</m>, as seen in the graph below. </p> 

<p> Insert graph of sin and 2sin, labeled. </p>

<note>  <p> If instead we multiply the sine function by a positive number less than 1, we call this a <term> vertical compression </term>. For example, <m> \frac{1}{3}\sin(x) </m> is a vertical compression of <m>\sin(x)</m> by a factor of 3.</p> </note> 

<p> If we consider the function <m> g(x) = -2\sin(x)</m>, then based on our previous findings, we would expect the outputs of <m>g(x)</m> to be the outputs of <m> \sin(x) </m> multiplied by <m> -2</m>. This results in a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>2</m> and a <term>reflection </term> across the <m>x</m>-axis, as seen below: </p>

<p> Insert graph of sin and -2sin, labeled. </p>

<p>Finally, let us consider <m> g(x) =-2\sin(x)+3</m>. In this case, we are multiplying the outputs of <m>\sin(x)</m> by <m>-2</m>, and then adding 3. Graphically, this results in a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>2</m>, a reflection across the <m>x</m>-axis, and finally a <term> vertical shift </term> up by 3 units (note that subtracting 3 would result in a shift down). We graph this below. You should verify this by creating a table like the one above. </p>

<p> Insert graph of sin and -2sin+3, labeled. </p>

<p> Everything that we have done so far has involved <m> \sin(x)</m>. However, if we replace <m>\sin(
x)</m> with any of the other trigonometric functions, we will see the same results. </p>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>Describe how the graph of <m> h(x) = -4\cos(x)+2 </m> differs from the graph of <m>f(x) = \cos(x) </m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
    	<p> The graph of <m> h(x) </m> is the result of starting with the graph of <m>f(x)</m> and vertically stretching it by a factor of 4, then reflecting it over the <m>x</m>-axis, and finally shifting up by 2 units. </p>

<p>Insert the two graphs </p>

</solution>
</example>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>Describe how the graph of <m> h(x) = \frac{1}{2}\tan(x)-1.5 </m> differs from the graph of <m>f(x) = \tan(x) </m>.</p> 
    </statement>
    <solution>
    	<p> The graph of <m> h(x) </m> is the result of starting with the graph of <m>f(x)</m>, vertically compressing it by a factor of 2, then shifting it down by 1.5 units. </p>

<p>Insert the two graphs </p>

</solution>
</example>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>Suppose we start with the graph of <m> f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, and we vertically stretch the graph by a factor of 3, then reflect over the <m>x</m>-axis, and finally shift down by 1 unit. Find the equation of the resulting function <m>j(x)</m>. </p>. 
    </statement>
    <solution>
    	<p> The equation of the resulting function is <m>j(x) = -3\sin(x)-1</m>. </p>
</solution>
</example>

<subsection><title> Horizontal Function Transformations</title> 

<p>So far we have only discussed vertical transformations, which affect the <m>y</m>-values of the function. Let us explore what happens when we apply horizontal transformations. This is where horizontal stuff will go, similar to vertical. </p> 


<p> The order in which we apply these function transformations matters. This is summarized below: </p>



<assemblage> <title> Summary of Function Transformations and Order</title> 

<p> Suppose we have applied vertical function transformations to <m>\sin(x)</m>, resulting in the function <m> f(x) = A\sin(B(x-h))+k </m>. The order of these transformations is: </p>
  <p>
        <ol>
            <li> Vertically stretch by a factor of <m> \abs{A}</m> if <m>|A| \gt 1</m> or vertically compress by a factor of <m> \abs{\dfrac{1}{A}}</m> if <m> 0 \lt |A| \lt 1</m>. If <m> A\lt 0</m> then also reflect about the <m>x</m>-axis. 
            </li>

            <li> Shift vertically up/ down by <m> \abs{k} </m>.
            </li>
 <li> Horizontal stretch by a factor of <m> \abs{B}</m> if <m>0 \lt |B| \lt 1</m> or horizontally compress by a factor of <m> \abs{\dfrac{1}{B}}</m> if <m> |B| > 1</m>. If <m> B \lt 0</m>, then also reflect about the <m>y</m>-axis.
            </li>

            <li> Shift horizontally left/ right by <m> \abs{h}</m>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
