<title>Complex Numbers</title>

<introduction>

<p> </p>

<p>
   All the mathematical work you have done so far has involved using <term>real numbers</term>. In this section, we will work with a new set of numbers called the <term>complex numbers</term><idx>complex numbers</idx>; it should be noted that the real numbers are actually a specific case of the complex numbers.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection><title>Motivation</title>

<p> </p>

<p>
  Let's start by providing some background as to where complex numbers arise from. Suppose that we want to solve for the <m>x</m>-intercepts of <m>f(x) = x^2 -2x + 2</m>. We can use the quadratic formula to obtain the <me>x</me>-intercepts, and when doing so, we obtain the following expression: <me>x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2-4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}</me>.

  Notice that <m>\sqrt{-4}</m> is <term>not</term> a real number because there are no real numbers whose square is negative. In fact, the square of any real number is either positive or zero. As a result, <m>f(x) = x^2 -2x + 2</m> has no real <m>x</m>-intercepts. This can be also be verified graphically since the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2</m> never crosses the <m>x</m>-axis. (INSERT GRAPH)

<subsection><title>Imaginary Numbers</title>
<p></p>
Even though the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we can still work with it by defining a new set of numbers, i.e. the complex numbers. Before we do any work with complex numbers, let's define the <term>imaginary unit</term><idx>imaginary unit</idx>.

<assemblage>
  <title>Imaginary Unit</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
      The imaginary unit <m>i</m> is defined as
          <m>i = \sqrt{-1}</m> or <m>i^2 = -1</m>.

  </p>

</assemblage>

It is important to be aware that the letter <m>i</m> is used to represent a constant, not a variable! With the number <m>i</m>, we can now define <term>imaginary numbers</term><idx>imaginary numbers</idx>.

<assemblage>
  <title>Imaginary Numbers</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
      Let <m>a > 0</m> be a real number. Then,
          <me>\sqrt{-a} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{a}i</me>.

  </p>

</assemblage>

Let's refer back to the example introduced earlier in this section. The value <m>\sqrt{-4}</m> can be expressed as follows:

<md>
  <mrow> \sqrt{-4} \amp= \sqrt{4(-1)}</mrow>
  <mrow> \amp= \sqrt{4}\sqrt{-1} </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp = sqrt{4}i </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp = 2i </mrow>.

</md>

Here are more examples of imaginary numbers <me>5i</me>, <me>\frac{2}{3}i</me>, <me>-24i</me>, and <me>\sqrt{15}i</me>.
</subsection>


<subsection><title>Complex Numbers</title>
  Recall that when we are solving for the <me>x</me>-intercepts of <me>f(x) = x^2 -2x + 2</me>, we obtained the following values for <me>x</me> with the quadratic formula:

  <md>x = \frac{2\pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}</md>.

  Using our new established knowledge of imaginary numbers, we find that <me>x = \frac{2\pm 2i}{2}</me> which implies that <me>x = 1 + i</me> or <me>1 - i</me>. These <me>x</me>-values are examples of <term>complex numbers</term><idx>complex numbers</idx>.

  <assemblage>
  <title>Complex Numbers</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
      A <term>complex number</term> can be written in the form

      <md> z = a + bi</md>

      where <me>a</me> and <me>b</me> are real numbers. Here, <me>a</me> is called the <term>real part</term> and <me>b</me> is called the <term>imaginary part</term>.
  </p>

</assemblage>

  From this definition, we can observe that all real numbers are actually complex numbers with imaginary part equal to <me>0</me>. Moreover, imaginary numbers are actually complex numbers with real part equal to <me>0</me>; these numbers are called <term>pure imaginary numbers</term>.

  The reader shoudl note that the real and imaginary parts of a complex number can never be combined. Hence, two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts equal and their imaginary parts are equal.

<assemblage>
  <title>Equality of Complex Numbers</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    Two complex numbers <me>z = a+bi</me> and <me>w = c+di</me> are equal if and only if <me>a = c</me> and <me>b = d</me>.

  </p>
</assemblage>

</subsection>


<subsection><title>Arithmetic of Complex Numbers</title>
  Like real numbers, we can use the following arithmetic operations with complex numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  <assemblage>
    <title>Sum and Difference of Complex Numbers</title>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Consider two complex number <me>z = a+bi</me> and <me>w = c+di</me>. Then their sum is given by
      <md>z+w = (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i</md>,
      and their difference is given by
      <md>z-w = (a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d)i</md>.

    </p>

  </assemblage>

  <example>
    <statement>
      Compute <me>(4+5i) + (8-6i)</me> and <me>(2-3i) - (5+2i)</me>.
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <md>(4+5i) + (8-6i) \amp= (4+8) + (5-6)i</md>
        <md> \amp= 12 + (-1)i</md>
        <md> \amp= 12 - i</md>

      </p>
      and

      <p>
        <md>(2-3i) - (5+2i) \amp= (2-5) - (-3+2)i</md>
        <md> \amp= (-3) - (-1)i </md>
        <md> \amp= -3 + i</md>.
      </p>

    </solution>

  </example>

  <p></p>
  When taking the product of two complex numbers, you should always remember that <me>i^2 = -1</me>. The product of two pure imaginary numbers is very nice and straightfoward to do.
  <assemblage>
    <title>Product of Pure Imaginary Numbers</title>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Consider two pure imaginary numbers <me>z = ai</me> and <me>w = bi</me>. Then their product is given by
      <md>zw = (ai)(bi) = (ab)i^2 = -ab</md>.
    </p>

  </assemblage>
  Finding the product of two complex is slightly different since we need to use the distributive property.
  <assemblage>
    <title>Product of Complex Numbers</title>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Consider two complex numbers <me>z = a+bi</me> and <me>w = c+di</me>. Then their product is given by
      <md>zw = (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i</md>.
    </p>
  </assemblage>

  <example>
    <statement>
      Compute <me>(3i)(4i)</me> and <me>(2+3i)(-3-2i)</me>.
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
      <md>(3i)(4i) \amp= (3\cdot 4)i^2 </md>
      <md>\amp= 12(-1)</md>
      <md>\amp= -12</md>,
      </p>
      and
      <p>
        <md>(2+3i)(-3-2i) \amp= (2(-3) - 3(-2)) + (2(-2) + 3(-3))i</md>
        <md>\amp= (-6 + 6) + (-4-9)i</md>
        <md>\amp= 0 - 13i</md>
        <md>\amp= -13i</md>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p></p>
  <text>WARNING:</text> The following property is true with real numbers, but it fails with complex numbers:
  <md>\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}</md>.
  Here is a counter-example: let <me>a = b = -2</me>. Then,
  <md>\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{(-2)(-2)} = \sqrt{4} = 2</md>,
  but
  <md>\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b} \amp= \sqrt{-2}\sqrt{-2}</md>
  <md> \amp= (\sqrt{2}i)(\sqrt{2}i)</md>
  <md> \amp= (\sqrt{2})^2i^2</md>
  <md> \amp = 2(-1) = -2.</md>
Hence, <me>\sqrt{ab} \neq \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}</me> (especially when <me>a</me>, <me>b</me> are both negative).
<p></p>
Finding the quotient of two complex numbers requires us to use the technique of rationalizing the denominator. We will consider two different types of quotients: division by a pure imaginary number and division by a complex number.

<assemblage>
  <title>Division by a Pure Imaginary Number</title>
  <p></p>
    <p>
    Consider a complex number <me>z = a+bi</me> and a pure imaginary number <me>w = ci</me>. Then,
    <md>\frac{z}{w} = \frac{a+bi}{ci} = \frac{a+bi}{ci}\cdot \frac{i}{i} = \frac{(a+bi)i}{ci^2} = \frac{-b + ai}{-c} = \frac{b - ai}{c}</md>.
    </p>
</assemblage>
<p></p>
When dividing by a complex number, we rationalize the denonimator by multiplying by the complex conjugate.
<assemblage>
  <title>Complex Conjugate</title>
  For any complex number <me>z = a + bi</me>, the number
  <md>\bar{z} = a - bi</md>
  is called the <term>complex conjugate</term> of <me>z</me>.
</assemblage>

<term>FACT:</term> The product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number. That is,
<md>z\bar{z} = (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2 -abi + abi - b^2i^2 = a^2 - b^2(-1) = a^2 + b^2</md>.

<assemblage>
  <title>Quotient of two Complex Number</title>
  Consider two complex numbers <me>z = a+bi</me> and <me>w = c + di</me>. Then,
  <md>\frac{z}{w} = \frac{a+bi}{c+di} = \frac{a+bi}{c+di}\cdot \frac{c-di}{c-di] = \frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2} + \frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}i</md>.
</assemblage>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Compute <me>\frac{8+9i}{2i}</me> and <me>\frac{4-2i}{2+3i}</me>.
    </p>
    <solution>
      <md>
        \frac{8+9i}{2i} \amp= \frac{8+9i}{2i}\cdot\frac{i}{i}
      </md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{(8+9i)i}{2i^2}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{8i + 9i^2}{2(-1)}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{8i + 9(-1)}{-2}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{-9+8i}{-2}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{9-8i}{2}</md>,
      <p>
        and
      </p>
      <md>
        \frac{4-2i}{2+3i} \amp= \frac{4-2i}{2+3i}\cdot \frac{2-3i}{2-3i}
      </md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{(4-2i)(2+3i)}{(2)^2 + (3)^2}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{(4(2)-(-2)(3)) + (4(3)+(-2)(2))i}{13}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{(8+6)+(12-4)i}{13}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{14+8i}{13}</md>.
    </solution>

<subsection><title>Graphing Compex Numbers</title>
  Like real numbers, we can actually graph complex numbers. To plot a complex number, we will utilize a plane called the <term>complex plane</term><idx>complex plane</idx>. The complex plane has two axes; the horizontal axis (<term>real axis</term>) will be used to plot the real part, and the vertical axis (<term>imaginary axis</term>) will be used to plot the imaginary part. The point where the real and imaginary axes cross is called the origin, and it is denoted by <me>(0,0)</me>.

  <assemblage>
  <title>Plotting a Complex Number</title>
  To plot a complex number <me>z = a + bi</me>, we move <me>a</me> units in the horizontal direction and then we move <me>b</me> units in the vertical direction.
</assemblage>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>Plot the complex numbers <me>2+4i</me>, <me>-2+6i</me>, and <me>-3-i</me> in the complex plane</p>.
  </statement>
  <solution>
    To plot <me>2+4i</me>, we move <me>2</me> units to the right from the origin, and then we move <me>3</me> units up. To plot <me>-2+6i</me>, we move <me>2</me> units to the left from the origin, and then we move <me>6</me> units up. To plot <me>-3-i</me>, we move <me>3</me> units to the left from the origin, and then we move <me>1</me> unit down.
  </solution>
</example>

<p></p>

REMARK: Whenever we plot a complex number <m>z = a + bi</m>, we sometimes use the notation <m>(a,b)</m> to denote a point in the complex plane. In this context, <m>(a,b)</m> represents a single complex number whose real part is <m>a</m> and imaginary part is <m>b</m>.

<p></p>
We can actually measure the distance a point in the complex plane is from the origin using the Pythagorean theorem. This distance is called the <term>modulus</term><idx>modulus</idx>.
<assemblage>
  <title>Modulus of a Complex Number</title>
  The <term>modulus</term> of a complex number <m>z = a + bi</m> is given by <me>|z| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}</me> Observe that <m>|z| \geq 0</m>.
</assemblage>

<example>
<statement>Compute the modulus of <m>z = 3 + 4i</m> and <m>w = -1 + i</m>.
<solution><me>|z| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5</me> and <me>|w| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2}</me></solution>
</statement>

</example>

<example>
  <statement>Plot all points in the complex plane that satisfy the equation <m>|z| = 1</m>.
  <solution> The points in the complex plane that satisfy the equation <m>|z| = 1</m> all have a distance of <m>1</m> unit from the origin. This means that all these points lie on a circle of radius <m>1</m> centered at the origin. --- INCLUDE FIGURE!!! </solution>

<subsection>
<title>Complex Numbers and Trigonometry</title>
<p></p>
<p>Now that we have familiarized ourselves with complex numbers, we are ready to make some connections to trigonometry. In the previous subsection, we talked about how to plot a complex number <m>z = a+bi</m> as a point <m>(a,b)</m> in the complex plane. Moreover, we talked about how the point <m>(a,b)</m> has a distance of <m>|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m> from the origin. It turns out that we can use our knowledge of polar coordinates to express a complex number in terms of the trignometric functions <m>\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>\cos(\theta)</m>. Recall that when converting a Cartesian coordiante <m>(x,y)</m> to a polar coordiante <m>(r,\theta)</m>, we used the following formulas:
<me>r^2 = x^2+y^2</me>
<me>\cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r}</me>
<me>\sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r}</me>
<me>\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}, \ x \neq 0</me>
The process of finding the <term>polar form of a complex number</term> is analogous. Let's consider a motivational example. Suppose we have the complex number <m>z = 1 + i</m>. We can plot <m>z</m> as follows in the complex plane. --- INSERT FIGURE
<p></p>
The modulus of <m>z</m> is clearly given by
<me>|z| = \sqrt{2}</me>
For convenience, put <m>r = |z|</m>. Observe that the ray drawn from the origin to the point <m>(1,1)</m> makes an angle <m>\theta</m> from the real axis. Then, we can use right triangle trigonometry to write <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as follows:
<me>a = r\cos(\theta) = \sqrt{2}\cos(\theta)=1</me>
<me>b = r\sin(\theta) = \sqrt{2}\sin(\theta)=1</me>
and
<me>\tan(\theta) = \frac{b}{a} = 1</me>
Since <m>\tan(\theta) = 1</m> and <m>a</m>, <m>b > 0</m>, we have from using the unit circle that <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}</m>. This means that
<me>a = \sqrt{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{4})</me>
and
<me>b = \sqrt{2}\sin(\frac{\pi}{4})</me>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Putting things together, the polar form of <m>z = 1 + i</m> is given by
  <me>z = \sqrt{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + \sqrt{2}\sin(\frac{\pi}{4})i = \sqrt{2}\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4})) </me>
</p>
<assemblage>
  <title>Polar Form for a Complex Number</title>
  The complex number <m>z = a+bi</m> in polar form is given by
  <me>z = r(\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta))</me>
  Here, <m>r = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m>, <m>a = r\cos(\theta)</m>, <m>b = r\sin(\theta)</m>, and <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{b}{a}</m> (assuming <m>a \neq 0</m>). Moreover, <m>0 \leq \theta \le 2\pi</m> is called the <term>argument</term> of the complex number and <m>r</m> is its <term>modulus</term>.
</assemblage>
</subsection>

<subsection>
  <title>Products and Quotients in Polar Form</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    A key reason for working with complex numbers in polar form is that it makes the computation of the product and quotient of complex numbers a bit more manageable.
  </p>
  <assemblage>
    <title>Product in Polar Form</title>
    If <m>z = r(\cos(\alpha)+i\sin(\alpha))</m> and <m>w = R(\cos(\beta)+i\sin(\beta))</m>, then
    <me>zw = rR(\cos(\alpha+\beta) + i\sin(\alpha+\beta))</me>
  </assemblage>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    Observe that the formula for computing the product of two complex numbers in polar form requires us to just multiply their moduli and add their arguments. Then we use the sum identities for sine and cosine. Here's a quick verification of how to obtain the formula for the product:
    <me>zw \amp= r(\cos(\alpha)+i\sin(\alpha))\cdot R(\cos(\beta)+i\sin(\beta))</me>
    <me>\amp= rR(\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)-\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) + i(\sin(\beta)\cos(\alpha)+\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta)))</me>
    <me>\amp = rR(\cos(\alpha+\beta)+i\sin(\alpha+\beta))</me>
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>Use polar form to compute the product of <m>z=1+i</m> and <m>w =-1-i</m>.
      <solution>
        The reader should verify that <m>z = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}))</m> and <m>w = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\frac{5\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{5\pi}{4}))</m>. Then,
        <me>zw \amp= (\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{2})(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{5\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{5\pi}{4}))</me>
        <me>\amp= 2(\cos(\frac{6\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{6\pi}{4}))</me>
        <me>\amp= 2(\cos(\frac{3\pi}{2})+i\sin(\frac{3\pi}{2}))</me>
        <me>\amp= 2(0+i(-1))</me>
        <me>\amp= -2i</me>
      </solution>
    </statement>

    <title>Quotient in Polar Form</title>
        If <m>z = r(\cos(\alpha)+i\sin(\alpha))</m> and <m>w = R(\cos(\beta)+i\sin(\beta))</m>, then
    <me>\frac{z}{w}= \frac{r}{W}(\cos(\alpha-\beta) + i\sin(\alpha-\beta))</me>
  </assemblage>
  The reader should verify that the formula used to compute the quotient of complex numbers in polar form is obtained with the difference identities for sine and cosine.
  <p></p>
  <example>
    <statement>Use polar form to compute the quotient of <m>z=1+i</m> and <m>w =-1-i</m>.</statement>

        <me>\frac{z}{w} \amp= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{5\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{5\pi}{4}))</me>
        <me>\amp= (\cos(-\frac{4\pi}{4})+i\sin(-\frac{4\pi}{4}))</me>
        <me>\amp= (\cos(-\pi)+i\sin(-\pi)</me>

<subsection>
  <title>Powers and Roots of Complex Numbers</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    We can use polar form to compute the powers and roots of a complex number with feasibility. Let's start with raising a complex number to a specific power. For example, if <m>z = r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))</m>, then using the double angle formulas we find that
    <me>z^2 \amp= (r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))^2</me>
    <me>\amp= r^2\big((\cos^2(\theta)-\sin^2(\theta))+i(2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta))\big) </me>
    <me>\amp= r^2\big(\cos(2\theta)+i\sin(2\theta)\big)</me>
    Hence,
    <me>z^2 = r^2\big(\cos(2\theta)+i\sin(2\theta)\big)</me>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    In general, for any positive integer <m>n</m>, a complex number raised to the <m>n</m>-th power is given by the following theorem.
  </p>
  <assemblage>
    <title>De Moivre's Theorem</title>
    If <m>z = r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))</m> is a complex number in polar form and <m>n</m> is a positive integer, then
    <me>z^n = r^n\big(\cos(n\theta)+i\sin(n\theta)\big)</me>
  </assemblage>

  <example>
    <statement>
      Let <m>z = \sqrt{3}+i</m>. Compute <m>z^4</m>.
      <solution>
        The reader should verify that <m>z = 2\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) + i\sin(\frac{\pi}{6}\big)</m>. Using De Moivre's Theorem, we find that
        <me>z^4 \amp= 2^4\big(\cos(4\cdot\frac{\pi}{6}) + i\sin(4\cdot \frac{\pi}{6})\big)</me>
        <me>\amp= 16\big(\cos(\frac{2\pi}{3})+i\sin(\frac{2\pi}{3})\big)</me>
        <me>\amp= 16\big(-\frac{1}{2} + i\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\big)</me>
        <me>\amp= -8 + 8\sqrt{3}i</me>
      </solution>
    </statement>
  </example>
  De Moivre's Theorem can also be used for fractional values of <m>n</m>, and this allows us to compute the roots of complex numbers. For example, let <m>n = \frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>z = r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))</m>. Then, De Moivre's Theorem gives
  <me>z^\frac{1}{2} = r^\frac{1}{2}\big(\cos(\frac{1}{2}\theta)+i\sin(\frac{1}{2}\theta)\big)</me>
  Now, recall that every number (real and complex) has two square roots. To find the other root, we add a multiple of <m>2\pi</m> to the argument of <m>z</m>. So, the polar form of <m>z</m> can also be given by
  <me>z = r\big(\cos(\theta + 2\pi)+i\sin(\theta+2\pi)\big)</me>
  Using De Moivre's Theorem, the second square root of <m>z</m> is given by
  <me>r^\frac{1}{2}\big(\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}+\pi) + i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}+\pi)\big)</me>

    <title>Roots of a Complex Number</title>
    A complex number <m>z = r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))</m> in polar form has <m>n</m> complex <m>n</m>-th roots given by
    <me>z_k = r^\frac{1}{n}\bigg(\cos\big(\frac{\theta+2\pi k}{n}\big)+i\sin\big(\frac{\theta+2\pi k}{n}\big)\bigg)</me>
    where <m>k = 0</m>, <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, ..., <m>n-1</m>.
