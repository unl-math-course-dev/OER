<title>Solving Generalized Equations</title>

<introduction>

<p> </p>

<p>
	In the previous section, we learned how to solve basic trigonometric equations like <m>\sin(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}</m>. In this section, we will learn how to solve more complicated trig equations, specifically, generalized trig equations.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection> <title> Solving Generalized Trig Equations </title>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Solve the trigonometric equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m> for all possible values of <m>\theta</m>. </p> </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
        	Similar to the examples in the previous section, we can sketch a graph of <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m> to see where it intersects with the line <m>y=1</m>. Just like before, the angles that correspond to the intersection points of these two functions are the solutions to the equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>. If we look at the graph, we can see that there are an infinite number of solutions to this equation. </p>

		<p>
        	The key difference between this example and examples that we've seen before is that we now have an input of <m>3\theta</m> instead of just <m>\theta</m> into our sine function. To solve this equation, we need to identify all angles, <m>\theta</m>, such that <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>. </p>
        <p>
        	To solve this problem, we can first isolate the sine function by dividing each side of the equation by <m>2</m>, which gives us <me>\sin(3\theta)=\frac{1}{2}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	While we know what angles have a sine value of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, it is less clear how to proceed when we have <m>3\theta</m> as our input. To make the problem more familiar, we can introduce a new variable <m>\phi</m> and set <m>\phi=3\theta</m>. Then, substituting <m>\phi</m> into our equation, we get <me>\sin(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	In <xref ref='sin-one-half-example' />, we found that the solutions to this equation are <me> \phi = \frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \phi = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	Since we want to solve for all possible values of <m>\theta</m>, we can use our substitution and replace <m>\phi</m> with <m>3\theta</m> in the solutions above. Therefore, we have that <me> 3\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} 3\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	Our final step in solving for <m>\theta</m> is to divide each side of the equations by <m>3</m>, so we have <me> \theta = \frac{\frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k}{3} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{\frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k}{3} \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	and simplifying we get <me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18} + \frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
		<p>
			Notice that when we divide the right side of our equations by <m>3</m>, we must divide each term by <m>3</m> in order to simplify the equations. Therefore, we end up adding multiples of <m>\frac{2\pi}{3}</m> to our initial solutions instead of multiples of <m>2\pi</m>. Also note that the sine function we are dealing with, <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m>, has a period of <m>\frac{2\pi}{3}</m>. </p>
		<!--<p>
			If we look back at the original equation, <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>, we see that the sine function <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m> has a period of <m>2\pi/3</m>, which is reflected in the solution sets. </p>-->
		<!--<p>
			We can also relate these solution sets back to the intersection points on the graph above. When <m>k=0</m>, we get the two initial solutions <m>\theta=\pi/18</m> and <m>\theta=5\pi/18</m>, shown on the graph below. </p>-->
    </solution>
</example>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Solve the trigonometric equation <m>2\sin(3(x-2)) = 1</m> for all possible values of <m>x</m>. </p>
      <solution>
        <p>
        To solve this problem, we can first isolate the sine function by dividing each side of the equation by <m>2</m>, which give us <me>\sin(3(x-2)) = \frac{1}{2}</me>  </p>
        <p>Set <m>\phi = 3(x-2)</m>. Then, substituting <m>\phi</m> into our new equation, we get <me>\sin(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}</me></p>
                <p>
        	In <xref ref='sin-one-half-example' />, we found that the solutions to this equation are <me> \phi = \frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \phi = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>We can use our substitution and replace <m>\phi</m> with <m>3(x-2)</m> in the solutions above. Therefore, we have that <me> 3(x-2) = \frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} 3(x-2) = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me></p>
        <p>We need to solve for <m>x</m>. To isolate the <m>x</m>, let's divide each side of the equations by <m>3</m>. Doing so and simplifying gives us <me> x-2 = \frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} x-2 = \frac{5\pi}{18} + \frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me></p>
        <p>Our final step in solving for <m>x</m> is to add <m>2</m> to each of the equations, so the solutions are: <me> x = 2+\frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} x = 2+\frac{5\pi}{18} + \frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me></p>
      </solution>
  </statement>
  
</example>


<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Solve the trigonometric equation <m>\tan(\frac{1}{5}(x+4)) = 3</m> for all possible values of <m>x</m>.    </p>
  <solution>
    <p>
      For this problem, the tangent function has already been isolated. So, set <m>\phi = \frac{1}{5}(x+4)</m>. Then, substituting <m>\phi</m> into the equation gives us <m>\tan(\phi) = 3</m>. We then take the inverse tangent to both sides of the equation. Doing so give us <m>\phi = \tan^{-1}(3)</m>. 
    </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>Using a calculator, we find that <me>\phi \approx 1.249</me>
  To get all solutions for <m>\phi</m>, recall that the tangent function has period <m>\pi</m>. Hence, <me>\phi \approx 1.249 + \pi k</me> where <m>k</m> is an integer.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Now, if we undo the substitution, we have that <me>\frac{1}{5}(x+4) \approx 1.249 + \pi k</me>. We can then use simple algebra to solve for <m>x</m> from this equation. Let's start by multiplying both sides by <m>5</m>. 
  This gives us <me>x+4 \approx 5(1.249 + \pi k)</me>
  Next, we subtract <m>4</m> to both sides of the previous equation. Then,
  <me>x \approx 5(1.249 + \pi k) - 4</me>
  Therefore, the solutions to the trig equation is given by 
  <me>x \approx 5(1.249 + \pi k) - 4, \ \text{ or equivalently, } \  x \approx 2.245 + 5\pi k, \text{ where } \ k \ \text{ is an integer.} </me>
  </p>
