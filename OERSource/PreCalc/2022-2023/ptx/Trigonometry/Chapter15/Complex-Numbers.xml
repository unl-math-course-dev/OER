<title>Complex Numbers</title>

<introduction>

<p> </p>

<p>
  All the mathematical work you have done so far has involved using <term>real numbers</term>. In this section, we will work with a new set of numbers called the <term>complex numbers</term><idx>complex numbers</idx>. It should be noted that the real numbers are actually a special case of the complex numbers. This will be explained in more detail later in this section. </p> 

</introduction>

<subsection><title>Motivation</title>

<p> </p>

<p>
  Let's start by providing some background as to where complex numbers arise from. Suppose that we want to solve for the <m>x</m>-intercepts of <m>f(x) = x^2 -2x + 2</m>. We can use the quadratic formula to obtain the <m>x</m>-intercepts, and when doing so, we obtain the following expression: <me>x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2-4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}</me>.
  
  Notice that <m>\sqrt{-4}</m> is <term>not</term> a real number because there are no real numbers whose square is negative. As a result, <m>f(x) = x^2 -2x + 2</m> has no real <m>x</m>-intercepts. We can also verify this finding graphically since the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2</m> never crosses the <m>x</m>-axis. (INSERT A GRAPH!)

<subsection><title>Imaginary Numbers</title>
<p></p>
<p>Even though the square root of a negative number is not a real number, there are many instances when we would like to be able to use it (e.g., finding the roots of <m>x^2-2x+2 = 0</m>. So, we need to define a new set of numbers that are not real numbers. Let's start by defining <term>imaginary numbers</term><idx>imaginary number</idx>.</p>

<assemblage>
  <title>Imaginary Numbers</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    An <term>imaginary number</term> is of the form
          <me>\sqrt{-a} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{a}i</me>
    where <m>a > 0</m> is a real number and <m>i</m> is an <term>imaginary unit</term>. Here, <m>i</m> is defined as
          <m>i = \sqrt{-1}</m> or <m>i^2 = -1</m>.
    
  </p>
  
</assemblage>
<p></p>
<note>
<p>
Unless stated otherwise, the letter <m>i</m> is used to represent a constant, not a variable! 
</p>
</note>
<p></p>
<p>  
Let's refer back to the motivational example introduced earlier in this section. The value <m>\sqrt{-4}</m> can be expressed as follows:
</p>
<md>
  <mrow> \sqrt{-4} \amp= \sqrt{4(-1)}</mrow>
  <mrow> \amp= \sqrt{4}\sqrt{-1} </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp= \sqrt{4}i </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp= 2i </mrow>.
</md>

Here are more examples of imaginary numbers <m>5i</m>, <m>\frac{2}{3}i</m>, <m>-24i</m>, and <m>\sqrt{15}i</m>. 
</subsection>


<subsection><title>Complex Numbers</title>
<p></p>
  <p>Recall that when solving for the <m>x</m>-intercepts of <m>f(x) = x^2 -2x + 2</m>, we obtained the following values for <m>x</m> with the quadratic formula:</p>
  
  <md>x = \frac{2\pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}</md>.
  
  <p>Using our new established knowledge of imaginary numbers, we find that <me>x = \frac{2\pm 2i}{2}</me> which implies that <m>x = 1 + i</m> or <m>x = 1 - i</m>. These <m>x</m>-values are examples of <term>complex numbers</term><idx>complex numbers</idx>. </p>
  
  <assemblage>
  <title>Complex Numbers</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
      A <term>complex number</term> is of the form
      
      <md> z = a + bi</md>
      
      where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers. Here, <m>a</m> is called the <term>real part</term> and <m>b</m> is called the <term>imaginary part</term>.
  </p>
  
</assemblage>
  <p></p>

<note>From this definition, we can observe that all real numbers are actually complex numbers with imaginary part equal to <m>0</m>. Moreover, imaginary numbers are actually complex numbers with real part equal to <m>0</m>; these numbers are called <term>pure imaginary numbers</term>.</note>
<p>
The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can never be combined. Hence, two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. </p>

<assemblage>
  <title>Equality of Complex Numbers</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    Two complex numbers <m>z = a+bi</m> and <m>w = c+di</m> are equal if and only if <m>a = c</m> and <m>b = d</m>.

  <p>Like real numbers, we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide complex numbers. </p>
  <assemblage>
    <title>Sum and Difference of Complex Numbers</title>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Consider two complex number <m>z = a+bi</m> and <m>w = c+di</m>. Then their sum is given by
      <me>z+w = (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i</me>,
      and their difference is given by
      <me>z-w = (a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d)i</me>.
      
    </p>
    
  </assemblage>
  
  <example>
    <statement>
      Compute <m>(4+5i) + (8-6i)</m> and <m>(2-3i) - (5+2i)</m>.   
    <solution>
      <p>
        <mrow>(4+5i) + (8-6i) \amp= (4+8) + (5-6)i</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= 12 + (-1)i</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= 12 - i</mrow>
        
      </p>
      and
      
      <p>
        <mrow>(2-3i) - (5+2i) \amp= (2-5) - (-3+2)i</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= (-3) - (-1)i </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= -3 + i</mrow>.
      </p>
      
    </solution>
        </statement>
  </example>
  
  <p></p>
  <p>When taking the product of two complex numbers, you should always remember that <me>i^2 = -1</me>. Finding the product of two pure imaginary numbers is relatively straightfoward.</p>

  <assemblage>
    <title>Product of Pure Imaginary Numbers</title>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Consider two pure imaginary numbers <m>z = ai</m> and <m>w = bi</m>. Then their product is given by
      <md>zw = (ai)(bi) = (ab)i^2 = -ab</md>.
    </p>
    
  </assemblage>
  <p></p>
  <p>Finding the product of two complex numbers is slightly different since we need to use the distributive property. </p>
  <assemblage>
    <title>Product of Complex Numbers</title>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Consider two complex numbers <m>z = a+bi</m> and <m>w = c+di</m>. Then their product is given by
      <md>zw = (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i</md>.
    </p>
  </assemblage>
  
  <example>
    <statement>
      Compute <m>(3i)(4i)</m> and <m>(2+3i)(-3-2i)</m>.
    <solution>
      <p>
      <md>(3i)(4i) \amp= (3\cdot 4)i^2 </md>
      <md>\amp= 12(-1)</md>
      <md>\amp= -12</md>,
      </p>
      and
      <p>
        <md>(2+3i)(-3-2i) \amp= (2(-3) - 3(-2)) + (2(-2) + 3(-3))i</md>
        <md>\amp= (-6 + 6) + (-4-9)i</md>
        <md>\amp= 0 - 13i</md>
        <md>\amp= -13i</md>.
      </p>
    </solution>
    </statement>
  </example>
  
  <p></p>
<p>  <text>WARNING:</text> The following property is true with real numbers, but it is not true with complex numbers:
  <md>\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}</md>.
  Here is a counter-example: let <m>a = b = -2</m>. Then,
  <md>\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{(-2)(-2)} = \sqrt{4} = 2</md>,
  but
  <md>\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b} \amp= \sqrt{-2}\sqrt{-2}</md>
  <md> \amp= (\sqrt{2}i)(\sqrt{2}i)</md>
  <md> \amp= (\sqrt{2})^2i^2</md>
  <md> \amp = 2(-1) = -2.</md>
Hence, <me>\sqrt{ab} \neq \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}</me> (especially when <me>a</me>, <me>b</me> are both negative). </p> 
<p></p>

<p>Finding the quotient of two complex numbers requires us to use the technique of rationalizing the denominator. We will consider two different types of quotients: division by a pure imaginary number and division by a complex number. </p>
  
<assemblage>
  <title>Division by a Pure Imaginary Number</title>
  <p></p>
    <p>
    Consider a complex number <m>z = a+bi</m> and a pure imaginary number <m>w = ci</m>. Then,
    <md>\frac{z}{w} = \frac{a+bi}{ci} = \frac{a+bi}{ci}\cdot \frac{i}{i} = \frac{(a+bi)i}{ci^2} = \frac{-b + ai}{-c} = \frac{b - ai}{c}</md>.
    </p>
</assemblage>
<p></p>

<p>When dividing by a complex number, we rationalize the denonimator by multiplying the complex conjugate.</p>

<assemblage>
  <title>Complex Conjugate</title>
  <p></p>
<p>  For any complex number <m>z = a + bi</m>, the number
  <md>\bar{z} = a - bi</md>
  is called the <term>complex conjugate</term> of <m>z</m>. </p>
</assemblage>
<p></p>
<p><term>FACT:</term> The product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number. That is,
<md>z\bar{z} = (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2 -abi + abi - b^2i^2 = a^2 - b^2(-1) = a^2 + b^2</md>.</p>

<assemblage>
  <title>Quotient of two Complex Number</title>
  <p></p>
<p>  Consider two complex numbers <m>z = a+bi</m> and <m>w = c + di</m>. Then,
  <md>\frac{z}{w} = \frac{a+bi}{c+di} = \frac{a+bi}{c+di}\cdot \frac{c-di}{c-di] = \frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2} + \frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}i</md>. </p>
</assemblage>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Compute <m>\frac{8+9i}{2i}</m> and <m>\frac{4-2i}{2+3i}</m>.
    </p>
    <solution>
      <md>
        \frac{8+9i}{2i} \amp= \frac{8+9i}{2i}\cdot\frac{i}{i}
      </md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{(8+9i)i}{2i^2}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{8i + 9i^2}{2(-1)}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{8i + 9(-1)}{-2}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{-9+8i}{-2}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{9-8i}{2}</md>,
      <p>
        and
      </p>
      <md>
        \frac{4-2i}{2+3i} \amp= \frac{4-2i}{2+3i}\cdot \frac{2-3i}{2-3i}
      </md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{(4-2i)(2+3i)}{(2)^2 + (3)^2}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{(4(2)-(-2)(3)) + (4(3)+(-2)(2))i}{13}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{(8+6)+(12-4)i}{13}</md>
      <md>\amp= \frac{14+8i}{13}</md>.

<subsection><title>Graphing Compex Numbers</title>
<p></p>
<p>  Like real numbers, we can also graph complex numbers. In order to plot a complex number, we will utilize a plane called the <term>complex plane</term><idx>complex plane</idx>. The complex plane has two axes: a horizontal axis (which we will call the <term>real axis</term>) to plot the real part, and a vertical axis (which we will call the <term>imaginary axis</term>) to plot the imaginary part. In addition, the point where the real and imaginary axes cross is called the <term>origin</term>, and it is denoted by <m>(0,0)</m>. </p>
 
  <assemblage>
  <title>Plotting a Complex Number</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>To plot a complex number <m>z = a + bi</m>, we move <m>a</m> units in the horizontal direction and then we move <m>b</m> units in the vertical direction. </p>
</assemblage>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>Plot the complex numbers <m>2+4i</m>, <m>-2+6i</m>, and <m>-3-i</m> in the complex plane</p>.
  <solution>
    To plot <m>2+4i</m>, we move <m>2</m> units to the right from the origin, and then we move <m>3</m> units up. To plot <m>-2+6i</m>, we move <m>2</m> units to the left from the origin, and then we move <m>6</m> units up. To plot <m>-3-i</m>, we move <m>3</m> units to the left from the origin, and then we move <m>1</m> unit down.  --- SEE FIGURE
  </solution>
    </statement>
</example>
INCLUDE FIGURES --- real and imaginary axes, and a figure for the example

<p></p>

<note>Whenever we plot a complex number <m>z = a + bi</m>, we sometimes use the notation <m>(a,b)</m> to denote a point in the complex plane. In this context, <m>(a,b)</m> represents a single complex number whose real part is <m>a</m> and imaginary part is <m>b</m>. </note>

<p></p>
We can also measure the distance a point in the complex plane is from the origin by using the Pythagorean theorem. This distance is called the <term>modulus</term><idx>modulus</idx>.
<p></p>
<assemblage>
  <title>Modulus of a Complex Number</title>
  <p></p>
  The <term>modulus</term> of a complex number <m>z = a + bi</m> is given by <me>|z| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}</me> Observe that <m>|z| \geq 0</m>.
</assemblage>

<example>
<statement>Compute the modulus of <m>z = 3 + 4i</m> and <m>w = -1 + i</m>.
<p></p>
<solution><me>|z| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5</me> and <me>|w| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2}</me></solution>
</statement>  

</example>

<example>
  <statement>Plot all points in the complex plane that satisfy the equation <m>|z| = 1</m>.
  <p></p>
  <solution> <p> The points in the complex plane that satisfy the equation <m>|z| = 1</m> all have a distance of <m>1</m> unit from the origin. This means that all these points lie on a circle of radius <m>1</m> centered at the origin. --- INCLUDE FIGURE! </p> </solution>

<subsection>
<title>Complex Numbers and Trigonometry</title>
<p></p>
<p>Now that we have familiarized ourselves with complex numbers, we are ready to make some connections to trigonometry. In the previous subsection, we talked about how to plot a complex number <m>z = a+bi</m> as a point <m>(a,b)</m> in the complex plane. Moreover, we talked about how the point <m>(a,b)</m> has a distance of <m>|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m> from the origin. We can use our knowledge of polar coordinates to express a complex number in terms of the trignometric functions <m>\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>\cos(\theta)</m>. Recall that when converting a Cartesian coordiante <m>(x,y)</m> to a polar coordinate <m>(r,\theta)</m>, we used the following formulas:
<me>r^2 = x^2+y^2</me>
<me>\cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r}</me>
<me>\sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r}</me>
<me>\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}, \ x \neq 0</me>
<p></p>
<p>The process of finding the <term>polar form of a complex number</term> is analogous. Let's consider a motivational example. Suppose we have the complex number <m>z = 1 + i</m>. We can plot <m>z</m> as follows in the complex plane. </p> --- INSERT FIGURE
<p></p>
The modulus of <m>z</m> is clearly given by
<me>|z| = \sqrt{2}</me>
For convenience, put <m>r = |z|</m>. Observe that the ray drawn from the origin to the point <m>(1,1)</m> makes an angle <m>\theta</m> from the real axis. Then, we can use right triangle trigonometry to write <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as follows:
<me>a = r\cos(\theta) = \sqrt{2}\cos(\theta)=1</me>
<me>b = r\sin(\theta) = \sqrt{2}\sin(\theta)=1</me>
and
<me>\tan(\theta) = \frac{b}{a} = 1</me>
Since <m>\tan(\theta) = 1</m> and <m>a</m>, <m>b > 0</m>, the unit circle tells us that <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}</m>. This means that
<me>a = \sqrt{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{4})</me>
and
<me>b = \sqrt{2}\sin(\frac{\pi}{4})</me>
</p>  
<p></p>
<p>
  Putting things together, the polar form of <m>z = 1 + i</m> is given by
  <me>z = \sqrt{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + \sqrt{2}\sin(\frac{\pi}{4})i = \sqrt{2}\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4})) </me> 
</p>
<assemblage>
  <title>Polar Form for a Complex Number</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>The complex number <m>z = a+bi</m> in polar form is given by
  <me>z = r(\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta))</me>
  Here, <m>r = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m>, <m>a = r\cos(\theta)</m>, <m>b = r\sin(\theta)</m>, and <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{b}{a}</m> (assuming <m>a \neq 0</m>). Moreover, <m>0 \leq \theta \le 2\pi</m> is called the <term>argument</term> of the complex number and <m>r</m> is its <term>modulus</term>.</p>

  <title>Products and Quotients in Polar Form</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    A key reason for working with complex numbers in polar form is that it makes computing the product and quotient of complex numbers more manageable. 
  </p>
  
  <assemblage>
    <title>Product in Polar Form</title>
    <p></p>
  <p>  If <m>z = r(\cos(\alpha)+i\sin(\alpha))</m> and <m>w = R(\cos(\beta)+i\sin(\beta))</m>, then
    <me>zw = rR(\cos(\alpha+\beta) + i\sin(\alpha+\beta))</me> </p>
  </assemblage>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    Observe that the formula for computing the product of two complex numbers in polar form requires us to simply multiply their moduli and add their arguments. Here's a quick verification of how to obtain the formula for the product using the sum identities for sine and cosine:
    <mrow>zw \amp= r(\cos(\alpha)+i\sin(\alpha))\cdot R(\cos(\beta)+i\sin(\beta))</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp= rR(\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)-\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) + i(\sin(\beta)\cos(\alpha)+\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta)))</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp = rR(\cos(\alpha+\beta)+i\sin(\alpha+\beta))</mrow>
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>Use polar form to compute the product of <m>z=1+i</m> and <m>w =-1-i</m>.
    <p></p>
      <solution>
       <p> You should verify that <m>z = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}))</m> and <m>w = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\frac{5\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{5\pi}{4}))</m>. Then,
        <md>zw \amp= (\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{2})(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{5\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{5\pi}{4}))</md>
        <md>\amp= 2(\cos(\frac{6\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{6\pi}{4}))</md>
        <md>\amp= 2(\cos(\frac{3\pi}{2})+i\sin(\frac{3\pi}{2}))</md>
        <md>\amp= 2(0+i(-1))</md>
        <md>\amp= -2i</md> </p>

    <title>Quotient in Polar Form</title>
        If <m>z = r(\cos(\alpha)+i\sin(\alpha))</m> and <m>w = R(\cos(\beta)+i\sin(\beta))</m>, then
    <me>\frac{z}{w}= \frac{r}{W}(\cos(\alpha-\beta) + i\sin(\alpha-\beta))</me>
  </assemblage>
  You should verify that the formula used to compute the quotient of complex numbers in polar form is obtained with the difference identities for sine and cosine. 
  <p></p>
  <example>
    <statement>Use polar form to compute the quotient of <m>z=1+i</m> and <m>w =-1-i</m>.
          <p></p>
          <solution>
        <p>You should verify that <m>z = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}))</m> and <m>w = \sqrt{2}(\cos(\frac{5\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{5\pi}{4}))</m>. Then,
        <md>\frac{z}{w} \amp= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}(\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{5\pi}{4})+i\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{5\pi}{4}))</md>
        <md>\amp= (\cos(-\frac{4\pi}{4})+i\sin(-\frac{4\pi}{4}))</md>
        <md>\amp= (\cos(-\pi)+i\sin(-\pi)</md>
        <md>\amp= (-1+i(0))</md>
        <md>\amp= -1</md> </p>

<subsection>
  <title>Powers and Roots of Complex Numbers</title>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    We can also use polar form to compute the powers and roots of a complex number with feasibility. For example, if <m>z = r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))</m>, then using the double angle formulas we find that
    <md>z^2 \amp= (r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))^2</md>
    <md>\amp= r^2\big((\cos^2(\theta)-\sin^2(\theta))+i(2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta))\big) </md>
    <md>\amp= r^2\big(\cos(2\theta)+i\sin(2\theta)\big)</md>
    Hence,
    <me>z^2 = r^2\big(\cos(2\theta)+i\sin(2\theta)\big)</me>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    In general, for any positive integer <m>n</m>, a complex number raised to the <m>n</m>-th power is given by the following theorem.
  </p>
  <assemblage>
    <title>De Moivre's Theorem</title>
    <p></p>
  <p>  If <m>z = r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))</m> is a complex number in polar form and <m>n</m> is a positive integer, then 
    <me>z^n = r^n\big(\cos(n\theta)+i\sin(n\theta)\big)</me> </p>
  </assemblage>
  
  <example>
    <statement>
    <p></p>  Let <m>z = \sqrt{3}+i</m>. Compute <m>z^4</m>. 
      <solution>
        You should verify that <m>z = 2\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) + i\sin(\frac{\pi}{6}\big)</m>. Using De Moivre's Theorem, we find that
        <md>z^4 \amp= 2^4\big(\cos(4\cdot\frac{\pi}{6}) + i\sin(4\cdot \frac{\pi}{6})\big)</md>
        <md>\amp= 16\big(\cos(\frac{2\pi}{3})+i\sin(\frac{2\pi}{3})\big)</md>
        <md>\amp= 16\big(-\frac{1}{2} + i\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\big)</md>
        <md>\amp= -8 + 8\sqrt{3}i</md> </p>
      </solution>
    </statement>

  De Moivre's Theorem can also be used for fractional values of <m>n</m>, and this allows us to compute the roots of complex numbers. For example, let <m>n = \frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>z = r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))</m>. Then, De Moivre's Theorem gives
  <me>z^\frac{1}{2} = r^\frac{1}{2}\big(\cos(\frac{1}{2}\theta)+i\sin(\frac{1}{2}\theta)\big)</me>
  Recall that every number (whether it's real or complex) has two square roots. In the case of complex numbers, we find the other root by adding a multiple of <m>2\pi</m> to the argument of <m>z</m>. So, the polar form of <m>z</m> can also be given by
  <me>z = r\big(\cos(\theta + 2\pi)+i\sin(\theta+2\pi)\big)</me>
  Using De Moivre's Theorem, the second square root of <m>z</m> is then given by
  <me>r^\frac{1}{2}\big(\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}+\pi) + i\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}+\pi)\big)</me>
