<introduction>
<p>In this section, we will be using inequality notation and interval notation to describe sets of numbers. If you would like to review these notations, refer to <xref ref="linear-inequalities" >Linear Inequalities</xref>.

<subsection><title>Domain and Range</title>
<p>
    Consider the graph of the function <m>f (x) =\sqrt{x + 4}</m> and observed that <m>f (x)</m> is undefined for <m>x</m>-values less than <m>-4</m>. For this function, we must choose <m>x</m>-values in the interval <m>[-4, \infty)</m>.

<p>
    All the points on the graph have <m>x</m>-coordinates greater than or equal to <m>-4</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-sq-root-again" text="type-global"/>. The set of all permissible values of the input variable is called the <term>domain</term><idx>domain</idx> of the function <m>f</m>.
</p>
</sidebyside>

<p>
    We also see that there are no points with negative <m>f (x)</m>-values on the graph of <m>f</m>: all the points have <m>f (x)</m>-values greater than or equal to zero. The set of all outputs or function values corresponding to the domain is called the <term>range</term><idx>range</idx> of the function. Thus, the domain of the function <m>f (x) =\sqrt{x + 4}</m> is the interval <m>[-4, \infty)</m>, and its range is the interval <m>[0, \infty)</m>. In general, we make the following definitions.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Domain and Range</title>
<p>
    The <term>domain</term><idx>domain</idx> of a function is the set of permissible values for the input variable. The <term>range</term><idx>range</idx> is the set of function values (that is, values of the output variable) that correspond to the domain values.
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    Using the notions of domain and range, we restate the definition of a function as follows.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Definition of Function</title>
<p>
    A relationship between two variables is a <term>function</term><idx>function</idx> if each element of the domain is paired with exactly one element of the range.
</p>
</assemblage>

<subsection><title>Finding Domain and Range from a Graph</title>
<p>
    We can identify the domain and range of a function from its graph. The domain is the set of <m>x</m>-values of all points on the graph, and the range is the set of <m>y</m>-values.

    <li>Recall that the points on the graph of a function have coordinates <m>(v, h(v))</m>.

<p>The rectangle described above is a convenient window in the plane for viewing the function. Of course, if the domain or range of the function is an infinite interval, we can never include the whole graph within a viewing rectangle and must be satisfied with studying only the important parts of the graph.</p>

    The range of the function is the set of all <m>f (x)</m>-values that appear on the graph. We can see in <xref ref="fig-parabola-with-finite-domain" text="type-global"/> that the lowest point on the graph is <m>(0, -6)</m>, so the smallest <m>f (x)</m>-value is <m>-6</m>. The highest point on the graph is <m>(4, 10)</m>, so the largest <m>f (x)</m>-value is <m>10</m>. Thus, the range of the function <m>f</m> is the interval <m>[-6, 10]</m>.

We can see in the graph that the highest point is <m>(5, 5)</m>, so the largest <m>g (x)</m>-value is <m>5</m>. We can also see that the smallest <m> g(x)</m>-value is as close to (10,0) as we can get coming from above, but not quite reaching (10,0). Since we also have all <m> g(x)</m>-values between 0 and 10, the range of the function <m>g</m> is the interval <m>(0, 5]</m>.

Similarly, for all <m>w</m>-values greater than <m>1</m> but less than or equal to <m>2</m>, the <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.68</m>, so the graph on this interval looks like a small piece of the line <m>p = 0.68</m>.

<solution><p>Since water consumption is capped at <m>120</m> HCF, the water consumption is anywhere between <m>0</m> and <m>120</m>; this means that the domain of this function is <m>[0,120]</m>.</p>

<p>For the range, we can consider each of the two "pieces" separately. Graphing the line <m>y=30+2w</m> on the domain <m>0\leq w\leq 50</m>, we see that the range of this piece is <m>[30, 130]</m>. If we graph the line <m>y=50+3w</m> on the domain <m>50\lt w\leq 120</m>, we see that the range of this piece is <m>(200, 410]</m>. All together, this means that the range is <m>[30, 130]\cup(200,410]</m>.</p>

<subsection><title>Finding the Domain from a Formula</title>
<p>If the domain of a function is not given as part of its definition, we assume that the domain is as large as possible. We include in the domain all <m>x</m>-values that make sense when substituted into the function's formula.</p>
<sidebyside widths="50% 35%">
<p>
     For example, the domain of the function  <m>f (x) =\sqrt{9 - x^2}</m>  is the interval <m>[-3, 3]</m>, because <m>x</m>-values less than <m>-3</m> or greater than <m>3</m> result in square roots of negative numbers. You may recognize the graph of <m>f</m> as the upper half of the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 9</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-semicircle" text="type-global"/>.

    We must omit any <m>x</m>-values that do not make sense in the function's formula. Because division by zero is undefined, we cannot allow the denominator of <m>\dfrac{1}{x-3}</m> to be zero. Since <m>x - 3 = 0</m> when <m>x = 3</m>, we exclude <m>x = 3</m> from the domain of <m>g</m>. Thus, the domain of <m>g</m> is the set of all real numbers except <m>3</m>.

<p>
    For the functions we have studied so far, there are only two operations we must avoid when finding the domain: division by zero and taking the square root of a negative number.</p>
    <p> Many common functions have as their domain the entire set of real numbers. In particular, a linear function <m>f (x) = b + mx</m> can be evaluated at any real number value of <m>x</m>, so its domain is the set of all real numbers. This set is represented in interval notation as <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>.
</p>
<p>
    The range of the linear function <m>f (x) = b + mx</m> (if <m>m \ne 0</m>) is also the set of all real numbers, because the graph continues infinitely at both ends. (See <xref ref="fig-two-graphs-of-lines" text="type-global" />a.) If <m>m = 0</m>, then <m>f (x) = b</m>, and the graph of <m>f</m> is a horizontal line. In this case, the range consists of a single number, <m>b</m>.

<subsection><title>Restricting the Domain</title>
<p>
    In many applications, we may restrict the domain of a function to suit the situation at hand.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-falling-algebra-book"><statement>
<p>
    The function <m>h = f (t) = 1454 - 16t^2</m> gives the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of the Sears Tower as a function of time. Give a suitable domain for this application, and the corresponding range.
</p>
</statement><solution>

<p>
    You can use the window
        \begin{align}
        \text{Xmin} \amp = -10 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 10\\
        \text{Ymin} \amp = -100 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 1500
        \end{align}
    to obtain the graph shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-falling-algebra-book" text="type-global"/>. </p>
<figure xml:id="fig-GC-falling-algebra-book"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-GC-falling-algebra-book"  width="40%"><description>GC graph of falling algebra book function</description></image></figure>
<p>
    Because <m>t</m> represents the time in seconds after the book was dropped, only positive <m>t</m>-values make sense for the problem. The book stops falling when it hits the ground, at <m>h = 0</m>. You can verify that this happens at approximately <m>t = 9.5</m> seconds. Thus, only <m>t</m>-values between <m>0</m> and <m>9.5</m> are realistic for this application, so we restrict the domain of the function <m>f</m> to the interval <m>[0, 9.5]</m>. </p>
    <p>During that time period, the height, <m>h</m>, of the book decreases from <m>1454</m> feet to <m>0</m> feet. The range of the function on the domain <m>[0, 9.5]</m> is <m>[0, 1454]</m>. The graph is shown in <xref ref="fig-falling-algebra-book" text="type-global"/>.

<example xml:id="exercise-boxes"><statement>
    <p>The children in Francine's art class are going to make cardboard boxes. Each child is given a sheet of cardboard that measures 18 inches by 24 inches. To make a box, the child will cut out a square from each corner and turn up the edges, as shown in <xref ref="fig-boxes" text="type-global"/>.</p><p></p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-boxes"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-boxes"  width="70%"><description>diagram for making box</description></image></figure><p></p>
    <ol label="a">
        <li>Write a formula <m>V = f (x)</m> for the volume of the box in terms of <m>x</m>, the side of the cut-out square.</li>
        <li>What is the domain of the function? (What are the largest and smallest possible values of <m>x</m>?)</li>
        <li>Graph the function and estimate its range.</li>
    </ol>
</statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>The height of the box is <m>x</m>; the width of the box is <m>24-2x</m>; and the length of the box is <m>18-2x</m>. Therefore the volume of the box can be given by <m>V = f (x) = x(24 - 2x)(18 - 2x)</m></p></li>
    <li><p>To find the domain, we need to ask ourselves what values of <m>x</m> make sense within the context of this problem. The children have to cut corners out, so <m>x</m> must be greater than <m>0</m>. If <m>x</m> is <m>9</m> or bigger, than the corners that are cut out will overlap, so <m>x</m> must be less than <m>9</m>. Therefore the domain is <m>(0,9) </m></p></li>
    <li><p>The range of <m>V</m> on the domain <m>(0, 9)</m> is <m>(0, 655)</m></p>
