<introduction>
<p>In <xref ref="chap2" text="type-global"/>, we defined a <term>relation</term> to be a collection of pairs of objects from two sets. In this section, we will talk about an important type of relation called a <term>function</term>.</p>

<assemblage><title>In this section, you will...</title>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>define <term>functions</term> and explore different representations of functions</p></li>
        <li><p>determine whether a relation is a function from various representations</p></li>
        <li><p>determine the domain and range of functions</p></li>
    </ul>
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>A <term>function</term> is a relation in which each <term>input</term> is related to exactly one <term>output</term>. Here, "input" and "output" refer to the first coordinate and the second coordinate, respectively.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following relation:
<me>\lbrace (-1,4),(0,7),(2,3),(3,3),(4,-2)\rbrace</me> In this relation, the input of <m>-1</m> is related to an output of <m>4</m>, the input of <m>0</m> is related to an output of <m>7</m>, etc. Since each input is related to exactly one output, this relation is a function.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Determine whether the following relation is a function.</p>

    <me>\lbrace (-4,-3),(-2,6),(0,3),(3,5),(3,7)\rbrace</me>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Although most of the inputs correspond to exactly one output, the input of <m>3</m> has two outputs: <m>5</m> and <m>7</m>. Since there is an input with more than one output, this relation is not a function.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>In <xref ref="chap2" text="type-global"/>, we defined the <term>domain</term> of a relation to be the set of first components. A more standard way to define domain is that it is the set of all of the inputs. Similarly, the range of a relation is the set of all of its outputs.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Determine whether the following relation is a function. State the domain and range of the relation.</p>

    <me>\lbrace (-4,2),(2,0),(3,5),(-3,1),(4,2)\rbrace</me>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Since each input corresponds to exactly one output, this relation is a function. The domain is the set of all <m>x</m>-coordinates and the range is the set of all <m>y</m>-coordinates.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{Domain: }\amp \lbrace -4,2,3,-3,4\rbrace \\ 
            \text{Range: }\amp \lbrace 2,0,5,1\rbrace
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Note that <m>2</m> being the output for two different inputs does not violate the definition of a function.</p>
</solution>
</example>
</introduction>

<subsection><title>Representations of Functions</title>

<p>All of the representations of relations can be used to represent functions as well. Each representation has unique characteristics that can be used to determine whether the relation is a function and to identify the domain and range.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Determine whether the relation given by the table below is a function. State the domain and range.</p>

    <sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
    <row bottom="major">
        <cell><m>x</m></cell>
        <cell><m>y</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
        <cell><m>4</m></cell>
        <cell><m>6</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
        <cell><m>2</m></cell>
        <cell><m>1</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
        <cell><m>0</m></cell>
        <cell><m>4</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
        <cell><m>5</m></cell>
        <cell><m>5</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
        <cell><m>-1</m></cell>
        <cell><m>4</m></cell>
    </row>
</tabular></sidebyside>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>The inputs are the entries in the left column. Each input corresponds to exactly one output, so this is a function. The domain is all of the numbers in the left column, and the range is all the numbers in the right column.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{Domain: }\amp \lbrace 4,2,0,5,-1\rbrace \\ 
            \text{Range: }\amp \lbrace 6,1,4,5\rbrace
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
</solution>
</example>

    </row>
</tabular></sidebyside>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>The input <m>5</m> appears in the table twice, and it has two different outputs. Since the input of <m>5</m> has more than one output, this is not a function.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{Domain: }\amp \lbrace 3,5,0,-2\rbrace \\ 
            \text{Range: }\amp \lbrace 7,10,-4,5\rbrace
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
</solution>
</example>

<p>The next two examples involve arrow diagrams. Pay special attention to the difference between the arrow diagram that represents the function and the arrow diagram that represents a non-function.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Determine whether the relation given by the arrow diagram below is a function. State the domain and range.</p>

    <p><image source="images/arrow-function.png" width="50%"></image></p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>In an arrow diagram, the arrows are drawn from an input to its correspond output. All of the inputs (the numbers in the left bubble) have an arrow taking them to exactly on number. Since each input corresponds to exactly one output, this relation is a function.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{Domain: }\amp \lbrace 0,3,-2,5\rbrace \\ 
            \text{Range: }\amp \lbrace 4,-3,-4\rbrace
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
</solution>
</example>

<statement>
    <p>Determine whether the relation given by the arrow diagram below is a function. State the domain and range.</p>

    <p><image source="images/arrow-nonfunction.png" width="50%"></image></p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>In this relation, there are two arrows pointing out of <m>-3</m>. This means that the input <m>-3</m> has two outputs, namely <m>2</m> and <m>-4</m>. Since there is an input with more than one output, this relation is not a function.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{Domain: }\amp \lbrace 7,-3,4\rbrace \\ 
            \text{Range: }\amp \lbrace -3,2,-4\rbrace
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
</solution>
</example>

<p>One of the most useful ways to represent a relation is with a graph. For each point on the graph, the input is the <m>x</m>-coordinate and the output is the <m>y</m>-coordinate. If one input has two different outputs, then there would be two distinct points with the same <m>x</m>-value. Since they have the same <m>x</m>-value, one would be directly above the other. For example, suppose we have a relation with the ordered pairs <m>(3,1)</m> and <m>(3,6)</m>. The input of <m>3</m> corresponds to two outputs, <m>1</m> and <m>6</m>, so this is not a function. Graphically, we have</p>

<image source="images/VLT-1.png" width="75%"><description>Vertical Line Test</description></image>

<p>We can visually determine whether a graph represents a function using the <term>vertical line test</term>. If any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a function. Returning to the previous graph, we can see that this is not a function since the points <m>(3,1)</m> and <m>(3,6)</m> intersect the same vertical line.</p>

<image source="images/VLT-2.png" width="75%"><description>Vertical Line Test</description></image>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Determine whether the relation given by the graph below is a function. State the domain and range.</p>

    <p><image source="images/ex-graph-function.png" width="60%"></image></p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Since no vertical line can be drawn to intersect two points, this relation passes the vertical line test and is therefore a function.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{Domain: }\amp \lbrace -2,0,2,4,5\rbrace \\ 
            \text{Range: }\amp \lbrace 1,3,4\rbrace
        \end{aligned}

    <p><image source="images/ex-graph-non-function1.png" width="60%"></image></p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>The vertical line <m>x=2</m> intersects two points of the graph, so this relation fails the vertical line test and is therefore not a function.</p>

<subsection><title>Function Notation</title>
<p> With the definition of a function comes special notation. If we consider each <m>x</m>-value to be the input that produces exactly one output, then we can use <term>function notation</term>:</p>

<md>
    <mrow> f(x)=y</mrow>
</md>

<p>The notation <m>f(x)</m> is read as, “<m>f</m> of <m>x</m>” and should not be confused with multiplication. If <m>f(x)=y</m> is a function, we say that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.</p>

<p>Algebra frequently involves functions, and so the notation becomes useful when performing common tasks. Here <m>f</m> is the function name, and <m>f(x)</m> denotes the value in the range associated with the value <m>x</m> in the domain. Functions are often named with different letters; some common names for functions are <m>f, g, h, C</m>, and <m>R</m>, but really any letter can be used for the name of a function. We can use function notation to describe a function given in any representation, but it is most frequently seen with equation. For example, consider the function <me>f(x)=2x-4</me>. This function relates each input <m>x</m> to the output <m>2x-4</m>. If we are looking for the output for a particular input, we can evaluate the function by plugging that value of <m>x</m> in. For instance,</p>

<md>
    <mrow> f(-3)\amp= 2(\alert{-3})-4=-10</mrow>
</md>

<p>Here the compact notation <m>f(-3)=-10</m> indicates that where <m>x=-3</m> (the input), the function results in <m>y=-10</m> (the output).</p>

<p>From above, we can see that our output depends on our input. Another way we define this is to call our input <m>x</m> the <term>independent variable</term> and our output <m>y</m> the <term>dependent variable</term>. Indeed, above, our function's output was <em>dependent</em> upon what the input was - when we put in <m>-3</m>, we got out the answer <m>-10</m>.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Consider the function <m>M=53+14t</m> where <m>M</m> represents miles from home on Gabby's bike trip as a function of <m>t</m>, the number of hours since Gabby left her office. Which is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable?</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>When translating word problems to equations it may help to remember that the phrase "a function of", tells us our input, or independent variable is time <m>t</m>. </p>

    <p>The independent variable is <m>t</m>, and the dependent variable is <m>M</m>.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>Function notation streamlines the task of evaluating. For example, use the function <m>h</m> defined by <m>h(x)=\frac{1}{2}x-3</m> to evaluate for <m>x</m>-values in the set <m>{-2,0,7}</m>.</p>

<md>
    <mrow>h(-2)=\frac{1}{2}(-2)-3=-1-3=-4</mrow>
    <mrow>h(0)=\frac{1}{2}(0)-3=0-3=-3</mrow>
    <mrow>h(7)=\frac{1}{2}(7)-3=\frac{7}{2}-3=\frac{1}{2}</mrow>
</md>


<p>Given any function defined by <m>h(x)=y</m> the input <m>x</m> can be any algebraic expression. For example:</p>

<md>
    <mrow>h(4a^3)=\frac{1}{2}(4a^3)-3=2a^3-3</mrow>
    <mrow>h(2x-1)=\frac{1}{2}(2x-1)-3=x-\frac{1}{2}-3=x-\frac{7}{2}</mrow>
</md>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Given <m>g(x)=x^2</m>, find <m>g(-2), g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)</m>, and <m>g(x+h)</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p> When evaluating, it is a best practice to begin by replacing the variables with parentheses and then substitute the appropriate values. This helps with the order of operations when simplifying expressions.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        g(\alert{-2})\amp =(\alert{-2})^2=4\\
        g\left(\alert{\frac{1}{2}}\right)\amp =\left(\alert{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2=\frac{1}{4}\\
        g(\alert{x+h})\amp =(\alert{x+h})^2=(x+h)(x+h)=x^2+2xh+h^2
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
</solution>
</example>

<p>At this point, it is important to note that, in general, <m>f(x+h)\neq f(x)+f(h)</m>. The previous example, where <m>g(x)=x^2</m>, illustrates this nicely.</p>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
    g(x+h)\amp\neq g(x)+g(h)\\
    (x+h)^2\amp\neq x^2+h^2
    \end{aligned}
</me>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Given <m>k(x)=\sqrt{2x+4}</m>, find <m>k(-2)</m>, and <m>k(0)</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        k(-2)\amp =\sqrt{2(\alert{-2})+4}=\sqrt{-4+4}=\sqrt{0}=0\\
        k(0)\amp = \sqrt{2(\alert{0})+4}=\sqrt{0+4}=\sqrt{4}=2\\
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
</solution>
</example>

<p>Sometimes the output is given and we are asked to find the input.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Given <m>f(x)=-3x+10</m>, for what values of <m>x</m> is <m>f(x)=4</m>?</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Here we're given the output and we're looking for the corresponding input(s). In other words, we're given <m>f(x)</m> and are looking for <m>x</m>.</p>
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        f(x) \amp= 4 \\
        -3x+10 \amp= 4 \\
        -3x \amp= -6 \\
        x \amp=2
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    <p>Therefore <m>f(2)=4</m>.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>We can use function notation to describe functions presented in other forms, including graphs, tables and diagrams.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>The graph below represents <m>g(x)</m>. Find <m>g(-1),\, g(0),</m> and <m>g(3)</m>. For what value(s) is <m>g(x)</m> equal to <m>3</m>?</p>

    <p> <image source="images/functionnotation-graph.png"></image></p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>The notation <m>g(-1)</m> means that we are looking for the output associated with the input of <m>-1</m>. Graphically, this means that <m>x=-1</m> and we're looking for the output of such point on the graph. The only point on the graph with an input of <m>-1</m> is <m>y=2</m>. Therefore <m>g(-1)=2</m>.</p>

    <p> <image source="images/functionnotation-graph2.png"></image></p>

    <p>Similarly, we find that <m>g(0)=1</m> and <m>g(3)=1</m>.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, to find the value(s) for which <m>g(x)</m> is equal to <m>3</m>, we are looking for input(s) associated with the output of <m>3</m>. Graphically, this means that <m>y=3</m> and we're looking for the input of such points on the graph. From the graph, we can see that <m>g(-2)=3</m> and <m>g(4)=3</m>.</p>

    <p> <image source="images/functionnotation-graph3.png"></image></p>

<section  xml:id="Algebra-of-Polynomials"><title>Algebra of Polynomials</title>
<introduction>
<p> A <term>polynomial</term> is an expression made up of a single term or sum of terms with only one variable in which each exponent is a whole number. For example,

<me>2x^3, \hspace{.5cm} 8x^4-x^2+9, \hspace{.5cm} x^9, \hspace{.5cm} x+4</me>

are all polynomials, while

<me>x^{-3}, \hspace{.5cm} 4x^{0.5}+2, \hspace{.5cm} \dfrac{1}{x^4}</me>

are not polynomials. Polynomials define functions of the form</p>

<md>
    <mrow>f(x)=a_n x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_1x+a_0.</mrow>
</md>

<p>Here <m>a_n</m> represents any real number and <m>n</m> represents any whole number. The <term>degree</term> of a polynomial with one variable is the largest exponent of all the terms. Typically, we arrange terms of polynomials in descending order based on their degree and classify them as follows:</p>

<md>
    <mrow>\begin{aligned}
        f(x)\amp =2 \ \alert{\text{   Constant function (degree }0\text{)}}\\
        g(x)\amp = 3x+2 \ \alert{\text{   Linear function (degree }1\text{)}}\\
        h(x)\amp = 4x^2+3x+2 \ \alert{\text{   Quadratic function (degree }2\text{)}}\\
        p(x)\amp = 5x^3+4x^2+3x+2 \ \alert{\text{   Cubic function (degree }3\text{)}}
        \end{aligned}
        </mrow>
    </md>

<p>In this course, we call any polynomial with degree higher than 3 an <m>n</m>th-degree polynomial. For example, if the degree is 4, we call it a fourth-degree polynomial; if the degree is 5, we call it a fifth-degree polynomial, and so on.</p>

<p>When a polynomial is arranged in descending order based on their degree, we call the first term of the sum the <term>leading term</term>, and the coefficient part of this term is called the <term>leading coefficient</term>.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Given <m>f(x)=3x^2+5x+17</m>, <m>g(x)=15x^{24}+36x^{22}+17x^4+31</m>, <m>h(x)=11x^2+17x^3+121x</m>, <m>j(x)=5x^3+2x+4x^3+3x+5</m>, and <m>k(x)=25</m>, state the degree, leading term, and leading coefficient of each polynomial.
    </p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Looking at <m>f(x)</m>, we see that the highest power of <m>x</m> is <m>2</m>, so the degree is <m>2</m>. The term with the highest degree is <m>3x^2</m>, meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is <m>3</m>, which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
    
    <p>Looking at <m>g(x)</m>, we see that the highest power of <m>x</m> is <m>24</m>, so the degree is <m>24</m>. The term with the highest degree is <m>15x^{24}</m>, meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is <m>15</m>, which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
    
    <p>Looking at <m>h(x)</m>, we see that the polynomial is not arranged in descending order of degree, so we will rearrange first.
        <me>h(x)=17x^3+11x^2+121x</me>
    Now we see that the highest power of <m>x</m> is <m>3</m>, so the degree is <m>3</m>. The term with the highest degree is <m>17x^{3}</m>, meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is <m>17</m>, which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
    
    <p>Looking at <m>j(x)</m>, we see that the polynomial is not arranged in descending order of degree, so we will rearrange first.
        <me>j(x)=5x^3+4x^3+2x+3x+5=9x^3+5x+5</me>
    Now we see that the highest power of <m>x</m> is <m>3</m>, so the degree is <m>3</m>. The term with the highest degree is <m>9x^{3}</m>, meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is <m>9</m>, which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
    
    <p>Looking at <m>k(x)</m>, we have just a constant. This is the same as <m>k(x)=25\cdot 1=25x^0</m>, so we see that the highest power of <m>x</m> is <m>0</m>, so the degree is <m>0</m>. The term with the highest degree is <m>25x^0=25</m>, meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is <m>25</m>, which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
</solution>

<p>One useful application of polynomials appears in physics. The height of an object launched upward, ignoring the effects of air resistance, can be modeled with the following quadratic function:</p>

<md>
    <mrow>h(t)=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_0t+s_0</mrow>
</md>

<p>With this formula, the height <m>h(t)</m> can be calculated at any given time <m>t</m> after the object is launched. The letter <m>g</m> represents acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth, which is 32 feet per second squared (or, using metric units, <m>g = 9.8</m> meters per second squared). The parameter <m>v_0</m> pronounced “v-naught,” or sometimes “v-zero,” represents the initial velocity of the object.  The parameter <m>s_0</m> represents the initial height from which the object was launched.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>An object is launched from the ground at a speed of <m>64</m> feet per second. Write a function that models the height of the object and use it to calculate the object's height at <m>1</m> second and at <m>3.5</m> seconds.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>We know that the acceleration due to gravity is <m>g=32</m> feet per second squared and we are given the initial velocity <m>v_0=64</m> feet per second. Since the object is launched from the ground, the initial height is <m>s_0=0</m> feet. Create the mathematical model by substituting these coefficients into the following formula:</p>
    
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        h(t)\amp =-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_ot+s_0\\
        h(t)\amp = -\frac{1}{2}(\alert{32})t^2+(\alert{64})t+\alert{0}\\
        h(t)\amp = -16t^2+64t
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Use this model to calculate the height of the object at <m>1</m> second and <m>3.5</m> seconds. </p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        h(\alert{1})\amp = -16(\alert{1})^2+64(\alert{1})=-16+64=48\\
        h(\alert{3.5})\amp = -16(\alert{3.5})^2+64(\alert{3.5})=-196+224=28
        \end{aligned}
    </me>


    <p> Our function is  <m>h(t)=-16t^2+64t</m>. This tells us that at <m>1</m> second the object is at a height of <m>48</m> feet, and at <m>3.5</m> seconds it is at a height of <m>28</m> feet.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>An object is dropped from a height of <m>6</m> meters. Write a function that models the height of the object and use it to calculate the object's height <m>1</m> second after it is dropped.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Our function is <m>h(t)=-4.9t^2+6</m>. Since
        <me>
            \begin{aligned}
            h(1) \amp= -4.9(1)^2+6 =1.1,

<subsection><title>Adding and Subtracting Polynomials</title>

<p>On occasion a special notation is used to indicate addition and subtraction of functions.  This mentioned here in the book so you have some exposure to the notation.  The notation is as follows:</p>

<md>
    <mrow>\text{Addition of functions: }(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)</mrow>
    <mrow>\text{Subtraction of functions: }(f-g)(x)=f(x)-g(x).</mrow>
    </md>

<p>When using function notation, be careful to group the entire function and add or subtract accordingly.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Given <m>f(x)=x^3-5x-7</m> and <m>g(x)=3x^2+7x-2</m>, find <m>f(x)+g(x)</m> and <m>f(x)-g(x)</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>The notation <m>f(x)+g(x)</m> indicates that we should add the given expressions.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        f(x)+g(x)\amp = (x^3-5x-7)+(3x^2+7x-2)\\
        \amp = x^3-5x-7+3x^2+7x-2\\
        \amp = x^3+3x^2+2x-9
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>The notation <m>f(x)-g(x)</m> indicates that we should subtract the given expressions. When subtracting, the parentheses become very important. We can eliminate them after applying the distributive property.</p>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
   f(x)-g(x) \amp = (x^3-5x-7)-(3x^2+7x-2)\\
    \amp = x^3-5x-7-3x^2-7x+2\\
    \amp = x^3-3x^2-12x-5
    \end{aligned}
    </me>

<p>Our solutions are <m>f(x)+g(x)=x^3+3x^2+2x-9</m> and <m>f(x)-g(x)= x^3-3x^2-12x-5</m>.</p>

</example>


<p>We may be asked to evaluate the sum or difference of two functions. We have the option to first find the sum or difference in general and then use the resulting function to evaluate for the given variable, or evaluate each first and then find the sum or difference.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Evaluate <m>f(3)-g(3)</m> given <m>f(x)=5x^2-x+4</m> and <m>g(x)=x^2+2x-3</m>.

    <p>First, find <m>(f-g)(x)</m>.</p>

    <me>
                \begin{aligned}

                \amp = 5x^2-x+4-x^2-2x+3\\
                \amp = 4x^2-3x+7
                \end{aligned}
                </me>

    <p>Now we substitute <m>3</m> in for the variable <m>x</m>.</p>

        \begin{aligned}
        f(\alert{3})-g(\alert{3}) \amp = 4(\alert{3})^2-3(\alert{3})+7\\
        \amp = 36-9+7\\
        \amp = 34
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>Our solution is <m>f(3)-g(3)=34</m>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, we could have found <m>f(3)</m> and <m>g(3)</m> and then subtracted the results to obtain our answer.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>
<p>Note: If multiple values are to be evaluated, it is best to find the sum or difference in general first and then use it to evaluate.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Given <m>f(x)=x^3+x-8</m> and <m>g(x)=2x^2-x+9</m>, evaluate <m>f(2)+g(2)</m> and <m>f(-2)+g(-2)</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>We will compute <m>f(x)+g(x)</m> on its own first.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            f(x)+g(x) \amp= (x^3+x-8)+(2x^2-x+9)=x^3+2x^2+1
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Using this, we see that</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            f(\alert{2})+g(\alert{2}) \amp= (\alert{2})^3+2(\alert{2})^2+1 \\
            \amp= 8+2(4)+1 \\
            \amp= 17

    <p>and</p>

        \begin{aligned}
            f(\alert{-2})+g(\alert{-2}) \amp= (\alert{-2})^3+2(\alert{-2})^2+1 \\

   <introduction>
    <p>The process of writing a number or expression as a product is called <term>factoring</term>. If we write the monomial <m>8x^7=2x^5\cdot 4x^2</m>, we say that the product <m>2x^5\cdot 4x^2</m> is a factorization of <m>8x^7</m> and that <m>2x^5</m> and <m>4x^2</m> are <term>factors</term>. Typically there are many ways to factor a monomial. Some factorizations of <m>8x^7</m> are</p>

    <md>
        \begin{aligned}
        <mrow>8x^7 \amp =2x^5\cdot 4x^2\text{,}</mrow>
        <mrow>8x^7 \amp =8x^6\cdot x \text{, and}</mrow>

        \end{aligned}
        </md>

    <p>Given two or more monomials, it will be useful to find the <term>greatest common factor (GCF)</term> of each. The GCF of the monomials is the product of the common variable factors and the GCF of the coefficients.</p>

    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Find the GCF of <m>25x^7y^2z</m> and <m> 15x^3y^4z^2</m>.
        </p></statement>
    <solution>

    <p>We begin by finding the GCF of the coefficients. In this case, <m>25=5\cdot 5</m> and <m>15=3\cdot 5</m>.
         It should be clear that GCF<m>(25,15)=5</m>.</p>

    <p>Next we determine the common variable factors with the smallest exponents.</p>

    <me> 25x^7\alert{y^2z}\, \, \text{ and }\, \, 15\alert{x^3}y^4z^2</me>

    <p>The common variable factors are <m>x^3</m>, <m>y^2</m> and <m>z</m>.
        Therefore, given the two monomials,</p>

    <me>\text{GCF}(25x^7y^2z,\, 15x^3y^4z^2)=5x^3y^2z.</me>

    </solution>
    </example>

    <p>It is worth pointing out that the GCF divides both expressions evenly.</p>

    <me>
        \frac{25x^7y^2z}{\alert{5x^3y^2z}}=5x^4 \text{ and }\frac{15x^3y^4z^2}{\alert{5x^3y^2z}}=3y^2z
        </me>

    <p>Furthermore, we can write the following:</p>

        <me>25x^7y^2z=\alert{5x^3y^2z}\cdot 5x^4 \text{ and }15x^3y^4z^2=\alert{5x^3y^2z}\cdot 3y^2z\text{.}
            </me>

        <p>The factors <m>5x^4</m> and <m>3y^2z</m> share no common factors other than 1; they are <term>relatively prime</term>.</p>

    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Determine the GCF of the following three expressions: <m>12a^5b^2(a+b)^5,\, 60a^4b^3c(a+b)^3</m>, and <m>24a^2b^7c^3(a+b)^2</m>.
        </p></statement>
    <solution>

        <p>We begin by finding the GCF of the coefficients. To do this, determine the prime factorization of each and then multiply the common factors with the smallest exponents.</p>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
            12\amp = 2^2\cdot 3\\
            60\amp = 2^2\cdot 3\cdot 5\\
            24\amp = 2^3\cdot 3
            \end{aligned}</me>

        <p>Therefore, the GCF of the coefficients of the three monomials is</p>

        <me>\text{GCF}(12,\, 60\, 24)=2^2\cdot 3=12\text{.}</me>

        <p>Next, we determine the common factors of the variables.</p>

        <me>12a^5\alert{b^2}(a+b)^5 \, \text{ and }\, 60a^4b^3c(a+b)^3\, \text{ and }\, 24\alert{a^2}b^7c^3\alert{(a+b)^2}</me>

        <p>The variable factors in common are <m>a^2\, b^2</m> and <m>(a+b)^2</m>. Therefore,</p>

        <me>\text{GCF}(12a^5b^2(a+b)^5,\, 60a^4b^3c(a+b)^3, \, 24a^2b^7c^3(a+b)^2)=12a^2b^2(a+b)^2\text{.}</me>

    <subsection><title>Factoring Out the GCF</title>


    <p>The application of the distributive property is the key to multiplying polynomials. For example,</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        \alert{6xy^2}(2xy+1)\amp = \alert{6xy^2}\cdot 2xy +\alert{6xy^2}\cdot 1\\
        \amp = 12x^2y^3+6xy^2\text{.}
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>The process of factoring a polynomial involves applying the distributive property in reverse to write each polynomial as a product of polynomial factors.</p>

    <me> \begin{aligned}
        \alert{a}(b+c)\amp =\alert{a}b+\alert{a}c\\
        \alert{a}b+\alert{a}c\amp =\alert{a}(b+c)
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    Consider factoring the result of the opening example:

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        12x^2 y^3+6xy^2\amp =\alert{6xy^2}\cdot 2xy+\alert{6xy^2}\cdot 1\\
        \amp = \alert{6xy^2}(\text{ ? })\\
        \amp =\alert{6xy^2}(2xy+1)\text{.}
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>We see that the distributive property allows us to write the polynomial <m>12x^2y^3+6xy^2</m> as a product of two factors <m>6xy^2</m> and <m>(2xy+1)</m>. Note that in this case, <m>6xy^2</m> is the GCF of the terms of the polynomial: GCF<m>(12x^2y^3,6xy^2)=6xy^2</m>.</p>

    <p>Factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) of a polynomial involves rewriting it as a product where a factor is the GCF of all of its terms.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        8x^3+4x^2-16x \amp = \alert{4x}(2x^2+x-4)\\
        9ab^2-18a^2b-3ab \amp= \alert{3ab}(3b-6a-1)
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>To factor out the GCF of a polynomial, we first determine the GCF of all of its terms. Then we can divide each term of the polynomial by this factor as a means to determine the remaining factor after applying the distributive property in reverse.</p>

    <example><statement>
        <p> Factor out the GCF of the polynomial <m>18x^7-30x^5+6x^3</m>.</p>

        <p>In this case, the GCF<m>(18,\, 30,\, 6) = 6</m>, and the common variable factor with the smallest exponent is <m>x^3</m>. The GCF of the polynomial is <m>6x^3</m>.</p>

    <p>The GCF of the terms is <m>9x^3y</m>. The last term does not have a variable factor of <m>z</m>, and thus <m>z</m> cannot be a part of the greatest common factor. If we divide each term by <m>9x^3y</m>, we obtain</p>

<subsection><title>Factoring by Grouping</title>

    <p>In this section, we outline a technique for factoring polynomials with four terms. First, review a preliminary example where the terms have a common binomial factor.</p>

    <example><statement>
        <p> Factor <m>7x(3x-2)-(3x-2)</m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>We begin by rewriting the second term <m>-(3x-2)</m> as <m>-1(3x-2)</m>.
          Next, consider <m>(3x-2)</m> as a common binomial factor and factor it out as follows:</p>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
            7x(3x-2)-(3x-2)\amp = 7x\alert{(3x-2)}-1\alert{(3x-2)}\\
            \amp = \alert{(3x-2)}(\, ?\, )\\
            \amp =(3x-2)(7x-1).
            \end{aligned}
        </me>

        <p>Factoring results in <m>7x(3x-2)-(3x-2)=(3x-2)(7x-1)</m>.</p>

    </solution>
    </example>


    <p>Factoring by grouping is a technique that enables us to factor polynomials with four terms into a product of binomials. This involves an intermediate step where a common binomial factor will be factored out. For example, suppose we wish to factor</p>

    <me> 3x^3-12x^2+2x-8\text{.}</me>

    <p>We begin by grouping the first two terms and the last two terms. Then factor out the GCF of each grouping:</p>

    <me>\underbrace{3x^3-12x^2}+\underbrace{2x-8}=\alert{3x^2}(x-4)+\alert{2}(x-4)</me>

    <p>In this form, the polynomial is a binomial with a common binomial factor, <m>(x-4)</m>.</p>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
            3x^3-12x^2+2x-8 \amp = (x-4)(\text{ ? })\\
            \amp = (x-4)(\alert{3x^2+2})
            \end{aligned}
            </me>

        <p>We can check our answer by multiplying:</p>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
            (x-4)(3x^2+2)\amp = 3x^3+2x-12x^2-8\\
            \amp = 3x^3-12x^2+2x-8\text{.}
            \end{aligned}
            </me>

        <example><statement>
            <p> Factor the polynomial <m>24a^4-18a^3-20a+15</m> by grouping.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>The GCF for the first group, <m>24a^4-18a^3</m>, is <m>6a^3</m>. We have to choose <m>5</m> or <m>-5</m> to factor out of the second group.</p>

            <p>Factoring out <m>+5</m> does not result in a common binomial factor. If we choose to factor out <m>-5</m>, then we obtain a common binomial factor and can proceed. Note that when factoring out a negative number, we change the signs of the factored terms.</p>

            <me>\begin{aligned}
                24a^4-18a^3-20a+15\amp = 6a^3(\, ?\, )-5(\, ?\, )\\
                \amp = 6a^3(4a-3)-5(4a-3)\\
                \amp = (4a-3)(\, ?\, )\\
                \amp =(4a-3)(6a^3-5)
                \end{aligned}
            </me>

            <p>Factoring <m>24a^4-18a^3-20a+15</m> results in <m>24a^4-18a^3-20a+15=(4a-3)(6a^3-5)</m>.</p>

        </solution>
        </example>


    <p>Sometimes we must first rearrange the terms in order to obtain a common factor.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p> Factor <m>ab-2a^2b+a^3-2b^2</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>If we simply factor the GCF out of the first group and last group, we do not get a common binomial factor.</p>

    <p>We must rearrange the terms, searching for a grouping that produces a common factor. In this example, we have a workable grouping if we switch the terms <m>a^3</m> and <m>ab</m>. </p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        ab-2a^2b+a^3-2b^2\amp = a^3-2a^2b+ab-2b^2\\
        \amp = a^2(a-2b)+b(a-2b)\\
        \amp = (a-2b)(a^2+b)
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Factoring <m>ab-2a^2b+a^3-2b^2</m> results in <m>ab-2a^2b+a^3-2b^2= (a-2b)(a^2+b)</m>.</p>

</solution>
</example>

<exercise><statement>
    <p> Factor <m>x^3-x^2y-xy+y^2</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Factoring <m>x^3-x^2y_xy+y^2</m> results in <m>x^3-x^2y_xy+y^2=(x-y)(x^2-y)</m>.</p>
</solution>
</exercise>

<p>Some polynomials cannot be factored, such polynomials are called prime. However, just because a polynomial cannot be factored with the above technique does not mean that it is necessarily prime. For example,</p>

<me>3x^3+5x^2-x+2.</me>

<p>This four-term polynomial cannot be grouped in any way to produce a common binomial factor. Despite this, the polynomial is not prime and can be written as a product of polynomials. It can be factored as follows:</p>

<me>3x^3+5x^2-x+2=(x+2)(3x^2-x+1)\text{.}</me>

<p>Factoring such polynomials is a topic for a more advanced algebra course. For now, we will limit our attempt to factor four-term polynomials to using the factor by grouping technique.</p>

    <subsection><title>Factoring Special Binomials</title>

    <p>We begin with the special binomial called <term>difference of squares</term>:</p>

    <me>a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)\text{.}</me>

    <p>To verify the above formula, multiply.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        (a+b)(a-b)\amp =a^2-ab+ba-b^2\\
        \amp = a^2 \alert{-ab+ab}-b^2\\
        \amp = a^2-b^2
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>We use this formula to factor certain special binomials.</p>

    <example><statement>
        <p> Factor <m>x^2-9y^2</m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>Identify the binomial as difference of squares and determine the square factors of each term.</p>

        <p>Here we can write </p>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
            x^2-9y^2=(\alert{x})^2-(\alert{3y})^2\text{.}
            \end{aligned}
        </me>

        <p>Substitute <m>a=x</m> and <m>b=3y</m> into the difference of squares formula.</p>

            a^2-b^2\amp=(a+b)(a-b)\\
            x^2-9y^2\amp = (x+3y)(x-3y)
            \end{aligned}
            </me>

        <p>We can multiply to check.</p>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
            (x+3y)(x-3y)\amp = x^2-3xy+3xy-9y^2\\
            \amp = x^2-9y^2
            \end{aligned}
        </me>

        <p>Factoring <m>x^2-9y^2</m> results in <m>x^2-9y^2=(x+3y)(x-3y)</m>.</p>

        <p> Factor <m>x^2-(2x-1)^2</m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>First, we identify this expression as a difference of squares.</p>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
            x^2-(2x-1)^2=(\alert{x})^2-(\alert{2x-1})^2
            \end{aligned}
        </me>

        <p>Substitute <m>a=x</m> and <m>b=2x-1</m> into the difference of squares formula.</p>

        <me>\begin{aligned}
            a^2-b^2\amp=(a+b)(a-b)\\
            x^2-(2x-1)^2\amp = (x+(2x-1))(x-(2x-1))\\
            \amp=(x+2x-1)(x-2x+1)\\
            \amp = (3x-1)(-x+1)
            \end{aligned}
        </me>

        <p>Factoring <m>x^2-(2x-1)^2</m> results in <m>x^2-(2x-1)^2=(3x-1)(-x+1)</m>.</p>

    </solution>
    </example>

        <p>The sum of squares <m>a^2+b^2</m> does not have a general factored equivalent over the real numbers. Care should be taken not to confuse this with the difference of squares.</p>

        <me>
            \begin{aligned}
            (a+b)^2\amp = (a+b)(a+b)\\
            \amp = a^2+ab+ba+b^2\\
            \amp = a^2+2ab+b^2
            \end{aligned}
            </me>

        <p>Therefore,</p>

        <me>(a+b)^2\neq a^2+b^2\text{.}</me>


        <p>It may be the case that the terms of a binomial have a common factor. If so, it will be difficult to identify it as a special binomial until we first factor out the GCF.</p>



        <p>When the degree of the special binomial is greater than two, we may need to apply the formulas multiple times to obtain a complete factorization. A polynomial is completely factored when it is prime or is written as a product of prime polynomials.</p>

           <!--

          <p>EXAMPLE</p>

          <p>When factoring, always look for resulting factors to factor further.</p>

          <p>EXAMPLE</p>

          <p>As an exercise, factor the previous example as a difference of cubes first and then compare the results. Why do you think we make it a rule to factor using difference of squares first?</p>

 <section  xml:id="Factoring-Trinomials"><title>Factoring Trinomials Using the <m>ac</m>-method</title>
<introduction>
<p>Some trinomials of the form <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> can be factored as a product of binomials using a technique called the <m>ac</m>-method. If such a trinomial can be factored, then the middle term, <m>bx</m>, can be replaced with two terms with coefficients whose sum is <m>b</m> and whose product is <m>ac</m>. This substitution results in an equivalent expression with four terms that can be factored by grouping.</p>

 <p>If factors of <m>ac</m> cannot be found to add up to <m>b</m> then the trinomial is prime.</p> 

<example><statement>
    <p> Factor <m>x^2+12x+20</m>.</p>

    <p>Here, <m>a=1</m>, <m>b=12</m>, and <m>c=20</m>, so we need to find two numbers whose sum is <m>12</m> and whose product is <m>20</m>. To do this, list all factorizations of <m>20</m> and search for factors whose sum equals <m>12</m>.</p>

    <p>Choose <m>20 = 2 \cdot 10</m> because <m>2 + 10 = 12</m>. Therefore, <m>12x=2x+10x</m>, and we can write <me>x^2+\alert{12x}+20=x^2+\alert{2x+10x}+20.</me>  </p>

     <p> Our factored form is <m>(x+10)(x+2)</m>.</p>

    <p>We check by multiplying the two binomials:</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}

 <p>
 Note: We made a choice in the above problem to write <m>12x=2x+10x</m>.  What would happen if we instead had written <m>12x=10x+2x</m>?  Notice that in the following calculation the answer is equivalent.

   <p> If the last term of the trinomial is positive, then either both of the constant factors must be negative or both must be positive.</p>

<p>There are no integer factors of 20 whose sum is 3. Therefore, the original trinomial cannot be factored as a product of two binomials with integer coefficients. The trinomial is prime, that is, it cannot be factored with integer terms.</p>

  <subsection  xml:id="Factoring-Trinomials-Part2"><title>Factoring Trinomials of the Form <m>ax^2+bx+c</m></title>

<p>Factoring trinomials of the form <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> can be challenging because the middle term is affected by the factors of both <m>a</m> and <m>c</m>. In general,</p>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
    \alert{a}x^2+\alert{b}x+\alert{c}\amp = (px+m)(qx+n)\\
    \amp = pqx^2+pnx+qmx+mn\\
    \amp =\alert{pq}x^2+\alert{(pn+qm)}x+\alert{mn}\text{.}
    \end{aligned}
    </me>

<p>This gives us</p>

<me>a=pq\text{ and }b=pn+qm,\text{ where }c=mn\text{.}</me>

      <p>In short, when the leading coefficient of a trinomial is something other than <m>1</m>, there will be more to consider when determining the factors using the trial and error method. The key lies in the understanding of how the middle term is obtained. Multiply <m>(5x+3)(2x+3)</m> and carefully follow the formation of the middle term.</p>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
    (5x+3)(2x+3)\amp = 5x\cdot 2x \stackrel{middle\: \: term}{\overbrace{\alert{+5x\cdot 3+3\cdot 2x}}}+3\cdot 3\\
    \amp = 10x^2\alert{+15x+6x}+9\\
    \amp=15x^2\alert{+21x}+9
    \end{aligned}
    </me>


<p>As we have seen before, the product of the first terms of each binomial is equal to the first term of the trinomial. The middle term of the trinomial is the sum of the products of the outer and inner terms of the binomials. The product of the last terms of each binomial is equal to the last term of the trinomial. Visually, we have the following.</p>

  <p> <image source="images/FactoringTrinomials1.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

<p>For this reason, we need to look for products of the factors of the first and last terms whose sum is equal to the coefficient of the middle term. For example, to factor <m>6x^2+29x+35</m>, we look at the factors of <m>6</m> and <m>35</m>.</p>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
    6\amp =1\cdot 6\\
    6\amp = \alert{2\cdot 3}
    \end{aligned}
    </me>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
    35\amp =1\cdot 35\\
    35\amp = \alert{5\cdot 7}
    \end{aligned}
</me>

<p>The combination that produces the coefficient of the middle term is <m> 2\cdot 7 +3\cdot 5=14+15=29</m>. Make sure that the outer terms have coefficients <m>2</m> and <m>7</m>, and that the inner terms have coefficients <m>5</m> and <m>3</m>. Use this information to factor the trinomial.</p>

<me>
    \begin{aligned}
    6x^2+29x+35 \amp = (2x\: \: \: \: )(3x\: \: \: \: )\\
    \amp =(2x+5)(3x+7)
    \end{aligned}
    </me>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Factor <m>5x^2+16xy+3y^2</m>.
        </p></statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Since the leading coefficient and the last term are both prime, there is only one way to factor each.
            </p>

            <me> 5=1\cdot 5 \text{ and } 3=1\cdot 3</me>

            <p>We begin by writing the factors of the first term, <m>5x^2</m>, as follows.</p>

            <me>5x^2+16xy+3y^2=(x\: \: \: )(5x\: \: \: )</me>

            <p>The middle and last term are both positive; therefore, the factors of 3 are chosen as positive numbers. In this case, the only choice is in which grouping to place these factors: <m>(x+y)(5x+3y)</m> or <m>(x+3y)(5x+y)</m>.</p>

            <p> We will determine which grouping is correct by multiplying each expression.</p>

            <me>\begin{aligned}
                (x+y)(5x+3y)\amp = 5x^2+3xy+5xy+3y^2\\
                \amp =5x^2+8xy+3y^2 \: \alert{\text{Incorrect}}\\
                (x+3y)(5x+y)\amp =5x^2+xy+15xy+3y^2\\
                \amp = 5x^2+16xy+3y^2
                \end{aligned}
                </me>

            <p> Our factored form is <m>5x^2+16xy+3y^2=(x+3y)(5x+y)</m>.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Factor <m>18a^2b^2-ab-4</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        First, we consider the factors of the coefficients of the first and last terms.
    </p>

    <me> \begin{aligned}
        18\amp =1\cdot 18\\
        \amp = \alert{2\cdot 9}\\
        \amp =3\cdot 6\\
        4\amp =\alert{1\cdot 4}\\
        \amp =2\cdot 2
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>We are searching for products of factors whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term, <m>-1</m>. After some thought, we can see that the sum of <m>8</m> and <m>-9</m> is <m>-1</m> and the combination that gives this follows.</p>

    <me>2(4)+9(-1)=8-9=-1</me>

    <p>We will use <m>2ab</m> and <m>9ab</m> as factors of <m>18a^2b^2</m>.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        18a^2b^2-ab-4=(2ab \: \:)(9ab\: \: )
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Next we use the factors <m>1</m> and <m>4</m> in the correct order so that the inner and outer products are <m>-9ab</m> and <m>8ab</m> respectively.</p>

    <me>18a^2b^2-ab-4=(2ab-1)(9ab+4)</me>

    <p> Our factored form is <m>(2ab-1)(9ab+4)</m>.</p>

</solution>
</example>


<p>It is a good practice to first factor out the GCF, if there is one. Doing this produces a trinomial factor with smaller coefficients. As we have seen, trinomials with smaller coefficients require much less effort to factor. This commonly overlooked step is worth identifying early.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Factor <m>12y^3-26y^2-10y</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        First, we will factor out the GCF.
    </p>

    <me> \begin{aligned}
        12y^3-26y^2-10y=2y(6y^2-13y-5)
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>After factoring out <m>2y</m>, the coefficients of the resulting trinomial are smaller and have fewer factors. We can factor the resulting trinomial using <m>6=2(3)</m> and <m>5=(5)(1)</m>. Notice that these factors can produce <m>-13</m> in two ways:</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        2(-5)+3(-1)=-10-3\amp =-13\\
        2(\alert{1})+3(\alert{-5})=2-15\amp =-13
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Since the last term is <m>-5</m>, the correct combination requires the factors <m>1</m> and <m>5</m> to be opposite signs. Here we use <m>2(1) = 2</m> and <m>3(-5) = -15</m> because the sum is <m>-13</m> and the product of <m>(1)(-5) = -5</m>.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        12y^3-26y^2-10y\amp =2y(6y^2-13y-5)\\
        \amp = 2y(2y \: \: )(3y\: \: )\\
        \amp = 2y(2y-5)(3y+1)
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>We check as follows.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        2y(2y-5)(3y+1) \amp =2y(6y^2+2y-15y-5)\\
        \amp = 2y(6y^2-13y-5)\\
        \amp =12y^3-26y^2-10y
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>The factor <m>2y</m> is part of the factored form of the original expression; be sure to include it in the answer.</p>

    <p> Our factored form is <m>2y(2y-5)(3y+1)</m>.</p>

</solution>
</example>



<p>It is also a good practice to consistently work with trinomials where the leading coefficient is positive. If the leading coefficient is negative, factor it out along with any GCF. Note that sometimes the factor will be <m>-1</m>.</p>

 <p>In all of the examples we've seen so far, the leading coefficient has been 1. We will now see what happens when the leading coefficient is not 1.

     </me>

     <p>In this case, the sum of the factors <m>-27</m> and <m>-4</m> equals the middle coefficient, <m>-31</m>. Therefore, <m>-31x=-27x-4x</m>, and we can write</p>

        2(-5)+3(-1)=-10-3\amp =-13\\
        2(\alert{1})+3(\alert{-5})=2-15\amp =-13
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Since the last term is <m>-5</m>, the correct combination requires the factors <m>1</m> and <m>5</m> to be opposite signs. Here we use <m>2(1) = 2</m> and <m>3(-5) = -15</m> because the sum is <m>-13</m> and the product of <m>(1)(-5) = -5</m>.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        12y^3-26y^2-10y\amp =2y(6y^2-13y-5)\\

        \amp = 2y(2y-5)(3y+1)
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>We check as follows.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        2y(2y-5)(3y+1) \amp =2y(6y^2+2y-15y-5)\\

 <section  xml:id="Solving-Polynomial-Equations"><title>Solving Polynomial Equations by Factoring</title>

<subsection><title>Reviewing General Factoring Strategies</title>

<p>We have learned various techniques for factoring polynomials with up to four terms. The challenge is to identify the type of polynomial and then decide which method to apply. The following outlines a general guideline for factoring polynomials:</p>

<p>
    <ol label="1">
        <li><p>Check for common factors. If the terms have common factors, then factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).</p></li>
        <li><p>If there are no common factors, determine the number of terms in the polynomial.</p>
            <ol label="a">
                <li><p>If the polynomial has four terms, try to factor by grouping.</p></li>
                <li><p>If it is a trinomial (3 terms), try using the <m>ac</m> method.</p></li>
                <li><p>If it is a binomial (2 terms), check if it is a difference of squares.</p></li>
            </ol></li>
        <li><p>Look for factors that can be factored further.</p></li>
        <li><p>Check by multiplying.</p></li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p> If an expression has a GCF, then factor this out first. Doing so is often overlooked and typically results in factors that are easier to work with. Furthermore, look for the resulting factors to factor further; many factoring problems require more than one step. A polynomial is completely factored when none of the factors can be factored further.</p>
    
<p> If none of these techniques work, it might be the case that the polynomial is prime, or does not factor.</p>


</subsection>

<subsection><title>Solving Polynomial Equations by Factoring</title>
<p>In this section, we will review a technique that can be used to solve certain polynomial equations. We begin with the <term>zero product property</term>:</p>

<md>
    <mrow>a\cdot b=0 \text{ if and only if }a=0\text{ or }b=0</mrow>
    </md>

<p>The zero-product property is true for any number of factors that make up an equation. In other words, if any product is equal to zero, then at least one of the variable factors must be equal to zero. If an expression is equal to zero and can be factored into linear factors, then we will be able to set each factor equal to zero and solve each equation.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>
        Solve <m>2x(x-4)(5x+3)=0</m>.
        </p></statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
               We set each variable factor equal to zero and solve.
            </p>

            <me>\begin{aligned}
                2x\amp= 0\\
                \frac{2x}{\alert{2}}\amp =\frac{0}{\alert{2}}\\
                x\amp =0
                \end{aligned}
                </me>
            <p>OR</p>
            <me>\begin{aligned}
                x-4\amp= 0\\
                x\amp =4
                \end{aligned}
            </me>

            <p>OR</p>
            <me>\begin{aligned}
                5x+3\amp= 0\\
                5x\amp = -3\\
                \frac{5x}{\alert{5}}\amp =\frac{-3}{\alert{5}}\\
                x\amp = -\frac{3}{5}
                \end{aligned}
            </me>

            <p>To check that these are solutions we can substitute back into the original equation to see if we obtain a true statement. Note that each solution produces a zero factor. </p>

            <p> The solutions are <m>x=0,4,-\frac{3}{5}</m>.</p>

        </solution>
    </example>

<p>Of course, most equations will not be given in factored form.</p>


<example><statement>
    <p>
        Solve <m>x^2-2x-35=0</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        We will first factor <m>x^2-2x-35</m> using the <m>ac</m>-method.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here <m>a=1,\, b=-2</m>, and <m>c=-35</m>.
    </p>

    <me> \begin{aligned}
        ac=1(-35)=-35
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Now we factor <m>-35</m>, and search for factors whose sum is <m>-2</m>.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        -35\amp = -1(35)\\
        \amp = -5(7)\\
        \amp = \alert{-7(5)}\\
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>In this case, the sum of the factors <m>-7</m> and <m>5</m> equals the middle coefficient, <m>-2</m>. Therefore, <m>-2x=5x-7x</m>, and we can write</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        x^2-2x-35+6=x^2+5x-7x-35.
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>We factor the equivalent expression by grouping.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
          x^2-2x-35+6\amp =x^2+5x-7x-35\\
        \amp = x(x+5)-7(x+5)\\
        \amp = (x+5)(x-7)
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p> Our factored form is <m>(x+5)(x-7)</m>. Now we can use the zero factor property to solve by setting each variable factor equal to zero.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        x+5\amp= 0\\
        x\amp =-5
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    <p>OR</p>
    <me>\begin{aligned}
        x-7\amp= 0\\
        x\amp =7
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>To check that these are solutions we can substitute back into the original equation to see if we obtain a true statement. Note that each solution produces a zero factor. </p>

    <p> The solutions are <m>x=-5,7</m>.</p>

</solution>
</example>


<exercise><statement>
    <p>
        Solve <m>x^2-8x-33=0</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p> The solutions are <m>x=-3,11</m>.</p>

</solution>
</exercise>


<p>Using the zero-product property after factoring an expression that is equal to zero is the key to this technique. However, the expression may not be given equal to zero, and so there may be some preliminary steps before factoring. The steps required to solve by factoring are outlined in the following example.</p>


<example><statement>
    <p>
        Solve <m>15x^2+3x-8=5x-7</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        We will first express the equation in standard form, with zero on the right hand side.
    </p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        15x^2+3x-8\amp =5x-7\\
        15x^2-5x+3x-8+7\amp =0\\
        15x^2-2x-1\amp =0
        \end{aligned}
        </me>

    <p>
        Now we can factor.
    </p>

    <me> \begin{aligned}
        (3x-1)(5x+1)=0
        \end{aligned}
    </me>


    <p> Now we can use the zero factor property to solve by setting each variable factor equal to zero.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        3x-1\amp= 0\\
        3x\amp =1\\
        x\amp =\frac{1}{3}
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    <p>OR</p>
    <me>\begin{aligned}
        5x+1\amp= 0\\
        5x\amp =-1\\
        x\amp=-\frac{1}{5}
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>To check that these are solutions we can substitute back into the original equation to see if we obtain a true statement. Note that each solution produces a zero factor. </p>

    <p> The solutions are <m>x=\frac{1}{3},-\frac{1}{5}</m>.</p>

</solution>
</example>

<exercise><statement>
    <p>
        Solve <m>(3x+2)(x+1)=4</m>.
    </p></statement>
<solution>
    <p> The solutions are <m>x=\frac{1}{3}, -2</m>.</p>

<p>Any polynomial with one variable is a function and can be written in the form,</p>

<p>A <term>root</term> of a function is a value in the domain that results in zero. In other words, the roots occur when the function is equal to zero, <m>f(x)=0</m>.</p>

<example><statement>

    <p>If we graph the function in the previous example we will see that the roots correspond to the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the function. Here the function <m>f</m>
