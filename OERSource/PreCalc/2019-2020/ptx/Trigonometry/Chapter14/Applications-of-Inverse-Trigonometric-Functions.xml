<title>Applications of Inverse Trigonometric Functions</title>

<introduction>

<p> </p>

<p>
	In the previous section, we learned how to solve basic trigonometric equations like <m>\sin(\theta)=1/2</m>. In this section, we will consider more complicated trig equations and explore how to solve these equations for all possible solutions as well as solutions on a given interval.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection> <title> Solving More Complicated Trig Equations </title>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Solve the trigonometric equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m> for all possible values of <m>\theta</m>. </p> </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
        	Similar to the examples in the previous section, we can sketch a graph of <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m> to see where it intersects with the line <m>y=1</m>. Just like before, the angles that correspond to the intersection points of these two functions are the solutions to the equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>. If we look at the graph, we can see that there are an infinite number of solutions to this equation. </p>

		<p>
        	The key difference between this example and examples that we've seen before is that we now have an input of <m>3\theta</m> instead of just <m>\theta</m> into our sine function. To solve this equation, we need to identify all angles, <m>\theta</m>, such that <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>. </p>
        <p>
        	To solve this problem, we can first isolate the sine function by dividing each side of the equation by 2, which gives us <me>\sin(3\theta)=\frac{1}{2}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	While we know what angles have a sine value of <m>1/2</m>, it is less clear how to proceed when we have <m>3\theta</m> as our input. To make the problem more familiar, we can introduce a new variable <m>\phi</m> and set <m>\phi=3\theta</m>. Then, substituting <m>\phi</m> into our equation, we get <me>\sin(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}</me> </p>
        <p>
        	In <xref ref='sin-one-half-example' />, we found that the solutions to this equation are <me> \phi = \frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \phi = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	Since we want to solve for all possible values of <m>\theta</m>, we can use our substitution and replace <m>\phi</m> with <m>3\theta</m> in the solutions above. Therefore, we have that <me> 3\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} 3\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	Our final step in solving for <m>\theta</m> is to divide each side of the equations by 3, so we have <me> \theta = \frac{\frac{\pi}{6}+2\pi k}{3} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{\frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k}{3} \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
        <p>
        	and simplifying we get <me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18} + \frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
		<p>
			Notice that when we divide the right side of our equations by 3, we must divide each term by 3 in order to simplify the equations. Therefore, we end up adding multiples of <m>2\pi/3</m> to our initial solutions instead of multiples of <m>2\pi</m>. Also note that the sine function we are dealing with, <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m>, has a period of <m>2\pi/3</m>. </p>
		<!--<p>
			If we look back at the original equation, <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>, we see that the sine function <m>f(\theta)=2\sin(3\theta)</m> has a period of <m>2\pi/3</m>, which is reflected in the solution sets. </p>-->
		<!--<p>
			We can also relate these solution sets back to the intersection points on the graph above. When <m>k=0</m>, we get the two initial solutions <m>\theta=\pi/18</m> and <m>\theta=5\pi/18</m>, shown on the graph below. </p>-->

<subsection> <title> Solutions on a Given Interval </title>

<p>
	In our previous examples, we have solved trigonometric equations for all solutions. However, we can also find a finite number of solutions on a given interval. The next example addresses this situation. </p>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Solve the trigonometric equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m> for all values of <m>\theta</m> in the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>. </p> </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
        	We solved this equation in the previous example above for all possible values of <m>\theta</m>. We found that <me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18} + \frac{2\pi}{3} k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} </me> </p>
		<p>
			To find values of <m>\theta</m> in the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>, we must test values of <m>k</m>. To better organize our work, we will create a "<m>k</m>-table" where we can keep track of different values of <m>k</m>, the angle <m>\theta</m> they yield, and whether or not that angle is in the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>.</p>

                <cell><m>\theta=\dfrac{5\pi}{18}+\dfrac{2\pi}{3}k</m></cell>
            </row>
    </tabular></sidebyside>

            






		<p>
			Starting with <m>k=0</m>, we get that <me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18} </me>
			Since both of these values are between <m>-\pi</m> and <m>\pi</m>, we include them in our solution set. </p>
		<p>
			Next, let us try <m>k=1</m>. When <m>k=1</m>, we get that
			<me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3}=\frac{13\pi}{18} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18}+\frac{2\pi}{3}=\frac{17\pi}{18} </me>
			Since both of these values are between <m>-\pi</m> and <m>\pi</m>, we include them in our solution set. </p>
		<p>
			If we try the next value of <m>k=2</m>, we get that
			<me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}+\frac{4\pi}{3}=\frac{25\pi}{18} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18}+\frac{4\pi}{3}=\frac{29\pi}{18} </me>
			Since both of these values are greater than <m>\pi</m>, we do not include them in our solution set. Moreover, we do not need to test any values of <m>k</m> greater than <m>2</m> since those values will also give us angles of <m>\theta</m> greater than <m>\pi</m>. </p>
		<p>
			We have now found all values of <m>k</m> greater than <m>0</m> that give us solutions to the equation <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>. Next, let us try values of <m>k</m> less than <m>0</m> to see if there are additional solutions. </p>
		<p>
			If <m>k=-1</m>, we get that
			<me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}-\frac{2\pi}{3}=-\frac{11\pi}{18} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18}-\frac{2\pi}{3}=-\frac{7\pi}{18} </me>
			Since both of these values are between <m>-\pi</m> and <m>\pi</m>, we include them in our solution set. </p>
		<p>
			Next, let us try <m>k=-2</m>. When <m>k=-2</m>, we get that
			<me> \theta = \frac{\pi}{18}-\frac{4\pi}{3}=-\frac{23\pi}{18} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta = \frac{5\pi}{18}-\frac{4\pi}{3}=-\frac{19\pi}{18} </me>
			Since both of these values are less than <m>-\pi</m>, we do not include them in our solution set. Moreover, we do not need to test any values of <m>k</m> less than <m>-2</m> since those values will also give us angles of <m>\theta</m> less than <m>-\pi</m>. Thus, we have found all solutions to <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m> in the interval <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>.</p>
		<p>
			To present these solutions in an organized way, we can create a <m>k</m>-table. Below is a table showing all values of <m>\theta</m> between <m>\pi</m> and <m>-\pi</m> such that <m>2\sin(3\theta)=1</m>. </p>

            <cell><me>\theta = \frac{5\pi}{18} + \frac{2\pi}{3} k</me></cell>
