<title>Comparing Exponential and Linear Growth</title>


<subsection><title>Exponential Growth</title>
<p>
    Consider the function
        <me>P(t) = 100 \cdot 3^t</me>
        describing the population, <m>P</m>, of a bacteria after t minutes. We say a function has <term>exponential growth</term> if during each time interval of a fixed length, the population is multiplied by a certain constant amount call the <term>growth factor</term><idx>growth factor</idx>. Consider the table:
</p>
<sidebyside width="60%"><image source="images/fig-table-bacteria-population"><description>table of bacteria population</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>
    We can see that the bacteria population grows by a factor of <m>3</m> each day. For this reason, we say that <m>3</m> is the growth factor for the function. Functions that describe exponential growth can be expressed in a standard form.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Exponential Growth</title>
<p>
    The function
    <me>P(t) = a (b)^t</me>
    models exponential growth.
</p>
<p>
    <m>a = P(0)</m> is the <term>initial value</term><idx>initial value</idx> or principal value of <m>P</m>;
</p>
<p>
    <m>b</m> is the <term>growth factor</term><idx>growth factor</idx>.
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    For the bacteria population, we have
    <me>P(t) = 100 \cdot 3^t</me>
    so <m>a = 100</m> and <m>b = 3</m>.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-bacteria"><statement>
<p>
    A colony of bacteria starts with <m>300</m> organisms and doubles every week.
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>Write a formula for the population of the bacteria colony after <m>t</m> weeks.</p></li>
        <li><p>How many bacteria will there be after <m>8</m> weeks? After <m>5</m> days?</p></li>
    </ol>
</p>
</statement><solution><p>
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>The initial value of the population was <m>a = 300</m>, and its weekly growth factor is <m>b = 2</m>. Thus, a formula for the population after <m>t</m> weeks is
        <me>P(t) = 300 \cdot 2^t.</me>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>After <m>8</m> weeks, the population will be
        <me>P(8) = 300 \cdot 2^8 = 76,800 \text{ bacteria}.</me>
        Because <m>5</m> days is <m>\frac{5}{7}</m> of a week, after <m>5</m> days the population will be
        <me>P\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)= 300 \cdot 2^{5/7} = 492.2.</me>
        We cannot have a fraction of a bacterium, so we round to the nearest whole number, <m>492</m>.</p></li>
    </ol>
</p></solution>
</example>

<warning>
<p>
    In <xref ref="example-bacteria" text="type-global"/>a, note that
    <me>300 \cdot 2^8 \ne 600^8.</me>
    According to the order of operations, we compute the power <m>2^8</m> first, then multiply by <m>300</m>.
</p>
</warning>

<example xml:id="exercise-fruit-flies"><statement>
<p>
    A population of <m>24</m> fruit flies triples every week. 
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>
            Write a formula for the population of fruit flies after <m>t</m> weeks.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            How many fruit flies will there be after <m>6</m> months? After <m>3</m> weeks? (Assume that a month equals <m>4</m> weeks.)
        </p></li>
    </ol>
</p>
</statement>
<solution><p>
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>The initial value of the population was <m>a=24</m>, and its weekly growth factor is <m>b=3</m>. Thus <m>P(t) = 24\cdot 3^t</m></p></li>
        <li><p>Since <m>1</m> month is <m>4</m> weeks, <m>6</m> months is <m>24</m> weeks.
        <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            P(24) \amp= 24\cdot24^3=331776 \\
            P(3) \amp= 24\cdot3^3=648
        \end{aligned}
        </me>
        So after <m>6</m> months there are <m>331776</m> flies and after <m>3</m> weeks there are <m>648</m> flies.</p></li>

<subsection><title>Linear Growth</title>
    <p>
Recall the following from Chapter 1:
</p>
<p>
    A function <m>y = f (x)</m> is  linear if it can be written in the form
    <me>f (x) = (\text{starting value}) + (\text{rate of change}) \cdot x.</me>
    The starting value, or the value of <m>y</m> at <m>x = 0</m>, is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write the equation of a line as
    <me>f (x) = b + mx</me>
    where the constant term, <m>b</m>, is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the line, and <m>m</m>, the coefficient of <m>x</m>, is the slope of the line. This form for the equation of a line is called the <term>slope-intercept form</term><idx>slope-intercept form</idx>.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
        If we write the equation of a linear function in the form,
        <me>f (x) = b + mx</me>
        then <m>m</m> is the <term>slope</term><idx>slope</idx> of the line, and <m>b</m> is the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>.
    </p>
</assemblage>

        <subsection><title>Comparing Linear Growth and Exponential Growth</title>
            <p>
                It may be helpful to compare linear growth <idx>linear growth</idx> and <idx>exponential growth</idx> exponential growth. Consider the two functions
                <me>L(t) = 5 + 2t ~\text{ and } ~ E(t) = 5 \cdot 2^t ~~~ (t \ge 0)</me>
                whose graphs are shown in <xref ref="fig-linear-vs-exponential" text="type-global"/>.

                <m>L</m> is a linear function with initial value <m>5</m> and slope <m>2</m>; <m>E</m> is an exponential function with initial value <m>5</m> and growth factor <m>2</m>. In a way, the growth factor of an exponential function is analogous to the slope of a linear function: Each measures how quickly the function is increasing (or decreasing).</p>
            <p> However, for each unit increase in <m>t</m>, <m>2</m> units are <em>added</em> to the value of <m>L(t)</m>, whereas the value of <m>E(t)</m> is <em>multiplied</em> by <m>2</m>. An exponential function with growth factor <m>2</m> eventually grows much more rapidly than a linear function with slope <m>2</m>, as you can see by comparing the graphs in <xref ref="fig-linear-vs-exponential" text="type-global"/> or the function values in  <xref ref="table-linear">Tables</xref> and <xref ref="table-exponential" text="global"/>.

                        If the value decreased exponentially, what was its annual decay factor? What was its annual percent depreciation?
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        Calculate the value of your car when it is <m>5</m> years old under each assumption, linear or exponential depreciation.
                    </p></li>
                </ol>
            </p></statement>
            <solution><p><ol label="a">
                <li><p>If the annual rate of decrease is <m>m</m>, then <me>20000-m=17000</me>. Thus <m>m=3000</m> so the rate of decrease is <m>\$3000</m> per year</p></li>
                <li><p>If the annual decay factor is <m>b</m>, then <me>20000b=17000</me> Thus <m>b= 0.85</m> so the annual decay factor is <m>0.85</m>. The annual percent depreciation is the percent change from <m>\$20,000</m> to <m>\$17,000</m>: <me>\text{percent change}=\frac{\text{amount change}}{\text{original amount}}=\frac{\$17,000-\$20,000}{\$20,000}=-0.15</me> Therefore the car's value depreciated by <m>15\%</m>.
            </p></li>
                <li><p>Based on the work about, if the car's value decreased linearly then the value of the car after <m>t</m> years is <me>L(t)=20000-3000t</me> If the value of the car depreciated exponentially, then the value of the car after <m>t</m> years is <me>E(t)=20000\cdot0.85^t</me> After <m>5</m> years,
                <me>
                    \begin{aligned}
                    L(5)\amp=20000-3000(5)=5000 \\
                    E(5)\amp=20000\cdot0.85^5\approx8874
                    \end{aligned}
                </me>
                After <m>5</m> years, the car will be worth <m>\$5000</m> under the linear model and worth approximately <m>\$8874</m> under the exponential model.</p></li>

        <p>
            In the last section, we listed several properies of exponential functions; namely, for <m>f(x)=a(b)^x</m> with <m>a>0</m>,
            <ul>
                <li> The domain is all real numbers and the range is all positive numbers.</li>
                <li> If <m>b>1</m> then the function is increasing, if <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m> then the function is decreasing.</li>
                <li> The <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,a)</m>; there is no <m>x</m>-\intercept.</li>
            </ul>
