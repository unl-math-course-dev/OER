<subsection><title>Increasing and Decreasing</title>
<p>Most people have intuition about what is means for something to be increasing and what it means for something to be decreasing.  However, we need to develop a solid mathematical way of defining increasing and decreasing.
</p>

<p>
Before defining increasing and decreasing is will be useful to recall interval notation.
</p>


<p>
            An <term>interval</term> is a set that consists of all the real numbers between two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The set <m>-2 \le x \le 2</m> includes its endpoints <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>, so we call it a <term>closed interval</term><idx>closed interval</idx>, and we denote it by <m>[-2, 2]</m> (see <xref ref="fig-numline-closed-vs-open" text="type-global"/>a). The square brackets tell us that the endpoints are included in the interval. An interval that does not include its endpoints, such as <m>-2 \lt x \lt 2</m>, is called an <term>open interval</term><idx>open interval</idx>, and we denote it with round brackets, <m>(-2, 2)</m> (see <xref ref="fig-numline-closed-vs-open" text="type-global"/>b).
        </p>
        
        <figure xml:id="fig-numline-closed-vs-open"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-numline-closed-vs-open.jpg"><description>closed interval and open interval</description></image>
        </figure>
        
        <warning>
            <p>
                Do not confuse the open interval <m>(-2, 2)</m> with the point <m>(-2, 2)</m>! The notation is the same, so you must decide from the context whether an interval or a point is being discussed.
            </p>
        </warning>
        
        <p>
            We can also discuss <term>infinite intervals</term><idx>infinite intervals</idx>, such as <m>x\lt 3</m> and <m>x\ge -1</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-numline-infinite-intervals" text="type-global"/>. We denote the interval <m>x\lt 3</m> by <m>(-\infty, 3)</m>, and the interval <m>x\ge -1</m> by <m>[-1, \infty)</m>. The symbol <m>\infty</m>, for infinity, does not represent a specific real number but rather indicates that the interval continues forever along the real line. Because of this, we will always use a round bracket along side <m>\pm \infty</m>.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig-numline-infinite-intervals"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-numline-infinite-intervals.jpg"  width="70%"><description>infinite intervals</description></image> </figure>

        <p>
            Some intervals are closed on one end and open on the other. We call such an interval a <term>half-open</term> or <term>half-closed</term> interval. Some examples of half-open/half-closed intervals are <m>[-2,9)</m> and <m>(0,23]</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, we can combine two or more intervals into a larger set. For example, the set consisting of <m>x\lt -1</m> or <m>x\gt 2</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-numline-disjoint-infinite-intervals" text="type-global"/>, is the <term>union</term><idx>union</idx> of two intervals and is denoted by <m>(-\infty,-2) \cup (2,\infty)</m>.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Many solutions of inequalities are intervals or unions of intervals.

<p>
Now that we have reviewed interval notation we are positioned to define increasing and decreasing functions
</p>






<assemblage><title>Definition of Increasing and Decreasing</title>
    <p>Let <m>y = f(x)</m> where <m>a\leq x \leq b.</m></p>
    <p>Then the function <m>f(x)</m> is said to be <term>increasing</term><idx>increasing</idx> on <m>(a,b)</m> if the value of <m>f(x)</m> increases as <m>x</m> increases on <m>(a,b)</m>.</p>
   <p>Then the function <m>f(x)</m> is said to be <term>decreasing</term><idx>decreasing</idx> on <m>(a,b)</m> if the value of <m>f(x)</m> decreases as <m>x</m> increases on <m>(a,b)</m>.</p>
</assemblage>


        <warning>
            <p>
				If the graph of a function has arrows on the ends then we can assume that the function continues in that same general direction.

<subsection><title>Measuring Steepness</title>
<p>Imagine you are an ant carrying a heavy burden along one of the two paths shown in <xref ref="fig-ant-climb" text="type-global" />. Which path is more difficult? Most ants would agree that the steeper path is more difficult. </p>
<sidebyside widths="50% 45%"><p>But what exactly is steepness? It is not merely the gain in altitude, because even a gentle incline will reach a great height eventually. Steepness measures how sharply the altitude increases. An ant finds the second path more difficult, or steeper, because it rises 5 feet while the first path rises only 2 feet over the same horizontal distance.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-ant-climb"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-ant-climb"><description>ant's climb</description></image></figure>
</sidebyside>



<p>To compare the steepness of two inclined paths, we compute the ratio of change in
altitude to change in horizontal distance for each path.</p>

<example xml:id="example-steep-trail"><statement>
    <p>Which is steeper, Stony Point trail, which climbs 400 feet over a horizontal distance of 2500 feet, or Lone Pine trail, which climbs 360 feet over a horizontal distance of 1800 feet?</p></statement>

<solution>
    <p>For each trail, we compute the ratio of vertical gain to horizontal distance. For Stony Point trail, the ratio is
    <me>\frac{400 \text{ feet}}{2500 \text{ feet}}= 0.16 </me>  
    and for Lone Pine trail, the ratio is
    <me>\frac{360 \text{ feet}}{1800 \text{ feet}}= 0.20.</me> 
    Lone Pine trail is steeper, because it has a vertical gain of 0.20 foot for every foot traveled horizontally. Or, in more practical units, Lone Pine trail rises 20 feet for every 100 feet of horizontal distance, whereas Stony Point trail rises only 16 feet over a horizontal distance of 100 feet.</p>

<subsection><title>Definition of Slope</title>
<p>
    To compare the steepness of the two trails in <xref ref="example-steep-trail" text="type-global" />, it is not enough to know which trail has the greater gain in elevation overall. Instead, we compare their elevation gains over the same horizontal distance. Using the same horizontal distance provides a basis for comparison. The two trails are illustrated in <xref ref="fig-trail-climb-grid" text="type-global" /> as lines on a coordinate grid.
</p>    
<figure xml:id="fig-trail-climb-grid"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-trail-climb-grid" width="70%"><description>trails on grid</description></image></figure>
<p>
    The ratio we computed in <xref ref="example-steep-trail" text="type-global" />,
    <me>\frac{\text{change in elevation}}{\text{change in horizontal position}}</me>  
    appears on the graphs in <xref ref="fig-trail-climb-grid" text="type-global" /> as
    <me>\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}</me> 
    For example, as we travel along the line representing Stony Point trail, we move from the point <m>(0, 0)</m> to the point <m>(2500, 400)</m>. The <m>y</m>-coordinate changes by <m>400</m> and the <m>x</m>-coordinate changes by <m>2500</m>, giving the ratio <m>0.16</m> that we found in <xref ref="example-steep-trail" text="type-global" />. We call this ratio the <term>slope</term> of the line.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Definition of Slope</title>
    <p>The <term>slope</term><idx>slope</idx> of a line is the ratio
    <me>\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}</me> 
    as we move from one point to another on the line.

    <me>\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}=\frac{3}{4}</me> 
</p></solution>
</example>

    </sidebyside>
</statement>
<solution><p><m>m=\dfrac{2}{8}=\dfrac{1}{4} </m></p></solution>
</example>

<p>
    The slope of a line is a number. It tells us how much the <m>y</m>-coordinates of points on the line increase when we increase their <m>x</m>-coordinates by 1 unit. For instance, the slope <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> in <xref ref="example-slope-grid" text="type-global" /> means that the <m>y</m>-coordinate increases by <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> unit when the <m>x</m>-coordinate increases by 1 unit. For increasing graphs, a larger slope indicates a greater increase in altitude, and hence a steeper line.
</p>
</subsection>






<subsection><title>Notation for Slope</title>
<p>
    We use a shorthand notation for the ratio that defines slope,
    <me>\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}.</me> 
    The symbol <m>\Delta</m> (the Greek letter delta) is used in mathematics to denote <em>change in</em>. In particular, <m>\Delta y</m> means <em>change in <m>y</m>-coordinate</em>, and <m>\Delta x</m> means <em>change in <m>x</m>-coordinate</em>. We also use the letter <m>m</m> to stand for slope. With these symbols, we can write the definition of slope as follows.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Notation for Slope</title>
<p>
    The <term>slope</term><idx>slope</idx> of a line is given by
    <me>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}\text{, }~\Delta x\ne 0.</me></p>

No matter which two points we use to calculate the slope, we will always get the same result. We will see later that lines are the only graphs that have this property.</p></note>
    <p> We can think of the slope as a scale factor that tells us how many units <m>y</m> increases (or decreases) for each unit of increase in <m>x</m>. Compare the lines in <xref ref="fig-slope-scale-factor" text="type-global" /></p>

    <me>\frac{\text{change in cost}}{\text{change in time}}= \frac{9 \text{ dollars }}{3 \text{ hours}}.</me>
</p>
<p>
    If we increase the length of the rental by 3 hours, the cost of the rental increases by 9 dollars. The slope gives the rate of increase in the rental fee, 3 dollars per hour. In general, we can make the following statement.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Rate of Change</title>
<p>
    The slope of a line measures the <term>rate of change</term><idx>rate of change</idx> of the output variable with respect to the input variable.
</p>  
</assemblage>

<p>
    Depending on the variables involved, this rate might be interpreted as a rate of growth or a rate of speed. A negative slope might represent a rate of decrease or a rate of consumption. The slope of a graph can give us valuable information about the variables.

<subsection><title>A Formula for Slope</title>
<p>
    We have defined the slope of a line to be the ratio <m>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m> as we move from one point to another on the line. So far, we have computed <m>\Delta y</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> by counting squares on the graph, but this method is not always practical. All we really need are the coordinates of two points on the graph.
</p>
<p>We will use <term>subscripts</term><idx>subscripts</idx> to distinguish the two points: let <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> be the coordinates of the first points and let <m>(x_2, y_2)</m> be the coordinates of the second point.
</p>

<sidebyside widths="32% 50%">
   <figure xml:id="fig-slope-formula"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-slope-formula"><description>slope of line</description></image></figure>

    <p>
        Now consider a specific example. The line through the two points <m>(2, 9)</m> and <m>(7,-6)</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig-slope-formula" text="type-global"/>. We can find <m>\Delta x</m> by subtracting the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the points: 
        <me>\Delta x = 7 - 2 = 5 </me>
        In general, we have 
        <me>\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 </me>
        and similarly
        <me>\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 .</me>
    </p>
</sidebyside>
<p>
    These formulas work even if some of the coordinates are negative; in our example, 
    <me>\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = -6 - 9 = -15.</me>
    By counting squares <em>down</em> from <m>(2,9)</m> to <m>(7,-6)</m>, we see that <m>\Delta y</m> is indeed <m>-15</m>. The slope of the line in <xref ref="fig-slope-formula" text="type-global" /> is </p>
    <p>\begin{align*}
            m\amp=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} 
            \\
            \amp=\frac{-15}{5}  = -3.
        \end{align*} 
    </p>
<p>
    We now have a formula for the slope of a line that works even if we do not have a graph.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Two-Point Slope Formula</title>
    <p>
        The slope of the line passing through the points <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m> is given by
        <me>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} 
            \text{, }~x_2 \ne x_1.</me>
    </p>
</assemblage>

<example xml:id="example-two-point-slope"><statement>
    <p>Compute the slope of the line in <xref ref="fig-slope-formula" text="type-global" /> using the points <m>(6, -3)</m> and <m>(4, 3)</m>. </p></statement>
    <solution><p>
        Substitute the coordinates of <m>(6, -3)</m> and <m>(4, 3)</m> into the slope formula to find
        <me>m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}= \frac{3 - (-3)}{4 - 6}
        = \frac{6}{-2}= -3.</me>
        This value for the slope, <m>-3</m>, is the same value found above.
    </p></solution>

<p>
    It will also be useful to write the slope formula with function notation. Recall that <m>f (x)</m> is another symbol for <m>y</m>, and, in particular, that <m>y_1 = f (x_1)</m> and <m>y_2 = f (x_2)</m>. Thus, if <m>x_2 \ne x_1</m>, we have
