<title>Polynomial Functions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	We have already encountered some examples of polynomial functions. Linear functions,
	<me>f (x) = ax + b</me>
	and quadratic functions
	<me>f (x) = ax^2 + bx + c</me>
	are special cases of polynomial functions. In general, we make the following definition.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Polynomial Function</title>
<p>
	A <term>polynomial function</term><idx>polynomial function</idx> is a function which can be written in the form
	<me>f (x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0</me>
	where <m>a_0</m>, <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>a_n</m> are constants and <m>a_n \ne 0</m>.
    </p>
<p>
    The parts making up the polynomial function which are of the form <m> a_ix^i </m> for some <m> i </m> are called <term> terms </term>. The term <m> a_nx^n </m> is call the <term> leading term </term>.
</p>
<p>
    The coefficient <m>a_n</m> of the highest power term is called the <term>leading coefficient</term><idx>lead coefficient</idx>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The power of <m> x </m> appearing in the leading term (in this case <m> n </m>), is the <term>degree</term> of the polynomial.
    </p>
</assemblage>

<p>
	Some examples of polynomials are
	<md>
		<mrow>
			f(x)\amp= 6x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 2, \amp g(x) \amp= 9x^5 - 2,
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			p(x) \amp = x^4 + x^2 + 1, \amp q(x) \amp= 2x^{10} - x^7 + 3x^6 + 5x^3 + 3x.
		</mrow>
	</md>
</p>
<p>
	Each of the polynomials above is written in <term>descending powers</term><idx>descending powers</idx>, which means that the highest-degree term comes first, and the degrees of the terms decrease from largest to smallest. Sometimes it is useful to write a polynomial in <term>ascending powers</term><idx>ascending powers</idx>, so that the degrees of the terms increase. For example, the polynomial <m>f(x)</m> above would be written as
	<me>
		f(x) = -2 + x - 4x^2 + 6x^3
	</me>
	in ascending powers.
</p>
<p>
    Note that <m>f(x)</m> has four non-zero terms, namely
<me>-2,\ x,\ -4x^2,\ \text{and}\ 6x^3. </me>
Since the term of <m> f(x) </m> of highest degree is <m> 6x^{\alert{3}}</m>, we say that <m> f(x)</m> has degree <m> \alert{3}</m>.

</example>

<p>
	In <xref ref="example-polynomial-product" text="type-global"/>a, we multiplied a polynomial of degree 1 by a polynomial of degree 3, and the product was a polynomial of degree 4. In <xref ref="example-polynomial-product" text="type-global"/>b, the product of three first degree polynomials is a third-degree polynomial. In <xref ref="example-polynomial-product2" text="type-global"/>, we multiplied a polynomial of degree 1 by a polynomial of degree 2, and the product was a polynomial is of degree 3. You might notice that the degree of the product is always the sum of the degrees of the factors; this is a useful property of polynomials that allows us to find the degree of a product without computing it.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Degree of a Product</title>
<p>
	The degree of a product of nonzero polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the factors. That is,
</p>
<p>
if <m>P(x)</m> has degree <m>m</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> has degree <m>n</m> (and both <m> P(x)</m> and <m> Q(x)</m> are nonzero), then their product
<m>P(x)Q(x)</m> has degree <m>n + m</m>.
</p>
</assemblage>

<example><statement><p>
	Let <m>P(x) = 5x^4 - 2x^3 + 6x^2 - x + 2</m>, and <m>Q(x) = 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 3</m>.

<subsection><title>Classifying Polynomials by Degree</title>
    <p>
        The graph of a polynomial function depends first of all on its degree. We have already studied the graphs of polynomials of degrees <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>2</m>.</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>A polynomial of degree <m>0</m> is a constant, and its graph is a horizontal line. An example of such a polynomial function is <m>f(x) = 3</m> (see <xref ref="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials" text="type-global"/>a).</li>
            <li> A polynomial of degree <m>1</m> is a linear function, and its graph is a straight line. The function <m>f(x) = 2x - 3</m> is an example of a polynomial of degree <m>1</m>. (See <xref ref="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials" text="type-global"/>b.)</li>
        </ul></p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-deg-0-and-1-polynomials"  width="70%"><description>horizontal line and line of nonzero slope</description></image></figure>
    
    <p>
        Quadratic functions, such as <m>f(x) = -2x^2 + 6x + 8</m>, are polynomials of degree <m>2</m>. The graph of every quadratic function is a parabola, with the same basic shape as the standard parabola, <m>y = x^2</m>. (See <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas2" text="type-global"/>.) Notice that the graph changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa at one point. This point of a parabola is the same as its vertex (which we defined in section 10.2).</p>

<subsection><title>Cubic Polynomials</title>
    
    <p>
        Do the graphs of all <term>cubic</term><idx>cubic</idx>, or third-degree, polynomials have a basic shape in common? We can graph a few examples and find out. Unlike the basic parabola, the graph of <m>y = x^3</m> is always increasing. At the origin, however, it changes from concave down to concave up. A point where the graph changes concavity is called an <term>inflection point</term><idx>inflection point</idx>. You do not need to concern yourself with concavity and inflection points in this course. However, if you continue on to Calculus, this definition will appear again!
    </p>
    
    <example xml:id="example-two-cubics"><statement>
        <p>
            Graph the cubic polynomial <m>P(x) = x^3 - 4x</m> and compare its graph with that of the basic cubic, <m>y = x^3</m>.

    </statement><solution>
        <p>
            The graph of the basic cubic is shown in <xref ref="fig-two-cubics" text="type-global"/>a. To help us understand the graph of the polynomial <m>P(x) = x^3 - 4x</m>, we will evaluate the function to make a table of values. We can do this by hand or use the Table feature on the graphing calculator.</p>

        </p>
    </solution></example>
    
    <p>
        Despite the differences in the central portions of the two graphs, they exhibit similar <em>long-run</em> behavior.
        <ul>
            <li>For very large and very small values of <m>x</m>, both graphs look like the power function <m>y = x^3</m>.</li>
            <li> The <m>y</m>-values increase from <m>-\infty</m> toward zero in the third quadrant, and they increase from zero toward <m>+\infty</m> in the first quadrant. Or we might say that the graphs start at the lower left and extend to the upper right.</li>
        </ul>
        All cubic polynomials display this behavior when their lead coefficients (the coefficient of the <m>x^3</m> term) are positive.

        <p>
            As in <xref ref="example-two-cubics" text="type-global"/>, both graphs have similar long-term behavior. The <m>y</m>-values decrease from <m>-\infty</m> toward zero as <m>x</m> increases from <m>-\infty</m>, and the <m>y</m>-values increase toward <m>+\infty</m> as <m>x</m> increases to <m>+\infty</m>. This long-term behavior is similar to that of the power function <m>y = x^4</m>. Its graph also starts at the upper left and extends to the upper right.
