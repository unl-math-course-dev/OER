	<p>Akinpelu was in graduate school at Johns Hopkins University when she first encountered “applied mathematics." She completed a dissertation in inventory systems management and in 1980 joined AT &amp; T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, NJ, where she worked for 25 years. The projects she worked on included developing new models for planning and managing telephone network call capacity under specific traffic conditions, and developing strategies for maintaining network stability. </p>
