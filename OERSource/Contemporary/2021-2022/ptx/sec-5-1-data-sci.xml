	<sidebyside widths = "60% 40%">

		<p><term>Data science</term> is a broad field that incorporates a variety of other subjects and can be applied almost anywhere, though traditionally it has most often been used in industry.  It is a field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data. Typically, <i>domain expertise</i> refers to advance knowledge of the type of business or organization that is hoping to benefit from analyzing data.
