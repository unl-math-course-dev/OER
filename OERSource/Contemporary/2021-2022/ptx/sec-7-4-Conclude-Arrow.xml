	<assemblage><title>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</title>
		<p>
			Any voting method that uses voters' ranked choices to decide an election with a single winner will violate at least one of the four criteria we've discussed: majority, monotonicity, Condorcet, or IIA.

		The map in <xref ref="electoral-systems-map"/> shows the systems used to elect the lower house of each country's legislature. You can see a larger version if you right-click and select <q>view image</q>. Note that the Borda count is included in the <q>other systems</q> category (green), but is used in only one of those countries: the Pacific island nation of Nauru. It is also used, however, to elect two seats in the parliament of Slovenia that are reserved for the Hungarian and Italian ethnic minorities.
