	<p></p>

	<p>Federico Ardila is a professor at San Francisco State University and an adjunct at Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia. His primary area of research is combinatorics.  Since combinatorics involves methods of counting, it is heavily used for discrete probability distributions. In addition to his own math research, Ardila has worked to encourage underrepresented groups within mathematics, with the goal of ensuring that everyone has access to joyful and meaningful mathematical experiences.</p>
