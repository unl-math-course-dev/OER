<title>How to compute the mean and standard deviation in both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets</title>

	<p>This tutorial uses the following data set. It contains the scores on a 5 point quiz for a class of 18 students.</p>

	<table xml:id="tutorial-table3"><caption>Number of students who earned each score</caption>
		<tabular top="minor" bottom="minor" left="minor" right="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>Score</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>4</cell>
				<cell>3</cell>
				<cell>2</cell>
				<cell>1</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Count</cell>
				<cell>6</cell>
				<cell>2</cell>
				<cell>3</cell>

	</table>

<p>
	You can follow the steps below by looking at the mean and standard deviation tab of the sample spreadsheet. If you are using Google Sheets, the example is found by <url href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_wnEQl5btBz6646XbhOrjyAYLRntf7dCunb-qRUJBDM/edit?usp=sharing">clicking here</url>. Note that you will need to switch to the other tab after you follow the link. Also note that this is a <alert>read-only</alert> file; to modify it, you have to make a copy for yourself.

	<ol>
		<li>Enter the value and count data (including the sum of the counts) into a fresh sheet, either by following directions of <xref ref="apdx-sec-bar-excel"/> (for Excel) or <xref ref="apdx-sec-bar-google"/> (for Google Sheets) or simply by copying columns A and B from the bar graph sheet into a second sheet.</li>
		<li>Enter the headings “V*C”, “SqDev”, “SqDev*C”, “MEAN”, “VARIANCE”, and “STDEV” in cells C1, D1, E1, F1, F4, G1.</li>
		<li><p>Compute the mean as a weighted average of the values.
			<ol>
				<li>Calculate the values times counts by entering “=A2*B2” in C2 and dragging the formula down to the end of the data.</li>
				<li>Compute the sum of values*counts by copying the formula from B9 to C9.</li>
				<li>Compute the mean by entering “=C9/B9” in F2.</li>
			</ol>
		</p></li>
		<li>4.	Compute the square deviations from the mean by entering “=(A2-F$2)^2” in D2 and dragging the formula to the end of the data.</li>
		<li><p>Compute the variance as a weighted average of the square deviations.
			<ol>
				<li>Calculate the SqDev times counts by entering “=D2*B2” in E2 and dragging the formula down to the end of the data.</li>
				<li>Compute the sum of SqDev *counts by copying the formula from C9 to E9.</li>
				<li>Compute the variance by entering “=E9/B9” in F5.</li>
			</ol>
		</p></li>
		<li>Compute the standard deviation by entering “=SQRT(F5)” in G2.</li>
		<li><p>Improve readability by changing the number format. This is found in slightly different menu options in each program, as follows.
			<ol>
				<li><em>In Excel:</em> Highlight columns D through G and choose Format, Format Cells, Number from the Cells menu.  </li>
				<li><em>In Google Sheets:</em> Highlight columns D through G, then under the Format menu, go to the Number sub-menu (near the top) and select the option “Number”.</li>
			</ol>
		</p></li>
		<li>Depending on the data, you might want to change the number of digits to be shown.  For integer values, 2 digits is best.</li>
	</ol>
