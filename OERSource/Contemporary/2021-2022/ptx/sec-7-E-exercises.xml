<introduction><title>So Where’s the Fair Method?</title>

<p>Here is a summary of whether each of our voting methods satisfies each of our fairness criteria:</p>

<p>So far none of the voting methods we have studied satisfy our four fairness criteria. At this point, you are probably asking why we keep looking at method after method just to point out that they are not fully fair. We must be holding out on the perfect method, right? Unfortunately, no.</p>

<p>To see a very simple example of how difficult voting can be, consider the election below: </p>

<p> No matter whom we choose as the winner, 2/3 of voters would prefer someone else!  This scenario is dubbed Condorcet’s Voting Paradox, and demonstrates how voting preferences are not transitive (just because A is preferred over B, and B over C, does not mean A is preferred over C).  It also demonstrates the impossibility of identifying a winner this election -- because there is no fair resolution.</p>

<p>Not only is it true that none of our voting methods satisfy all of the fairness criteria we care about, even worse, it turns out that there is no perfect voting method. </p>
	</introduction>

<subsection><title>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</title>


	<p>In 1949, a mathematical economist named Kenneth Arrow was able to prove that there is no voting method that will satisfy all the fairness criteria we have discussed.
</p>

	<assemblage><title>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</title>
		<p>
			Any voting method that uses voters' ranked choices to decide an election with a single winner will violate at least one of the four criteria we've discussed: majority, monotonicity, Condorcet, or IIA.
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<p>In other words, Arrow’s theorem means that no matter how hard we try to find one, we cannot find a voting method using ranked choices to find a winner that satisfies every fairness criteria we have studied here. Consequently, in any election a losing candidate can claim the outcome is unfair in some way… and be correct. This puts democracies in a difficult position: how can a winner of an election be determined in a manner that all constituents believe is consistently fair?</p>

	<p>The answer is, it can’t.  Instead, we change the question and focus on finding a voting method that satisfies the most – or the most important – fairness criteria.  Interestingly, the fact that there is no single fairest method might explain why there are many different voting methods used throughout the world.</p>

You can see a larger version if you right-click and select <q>view image</q>. Note that the Borda count is included in the <q>other systems</q> category (green), but is used in only one of those countries: the Pacific island nation of Nauru. It is also used, however, to elect two seats in the parliament of Slovenia that are reserved for the Hungarian and Italian ethnic minorities.</p>

	<p>There are so many different voting methods, including ones we haven't discussed in this chapter, and all have their pros and cons.  Fairness criteria can't tell us which method is the best, but they can at least provide some useful information to consider.  It is then up to a given community to consider the many options thoughtfully and chose one that will help it make the best collective decisions that it can.</p>
