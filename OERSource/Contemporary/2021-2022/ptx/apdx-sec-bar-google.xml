<title>How to make a bar graph in Google Sheets</title>

		<p>This tutorial uses the following data set. It contains the scores on a 5 point quiz for a class of 18 students.</p>

		<table xml:id="tutorial-table2"><caption>Number of students who earned each score</caption>
			<tabular top="minor" bottom="minor" left="minor" right="minor">
				<row>
					<cell>Score</cell>
					<cell>5</cell>
					<cell>4</cell>
					<cell>3</cell>
					<cell>2</cell>
					<cell>1</cell>
					<cell>0</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>Count</cell>
					<cell>6</cell>
					<cell>2</cell>
					<cell>3</cell>
					<cell>0</cell>
					<cell>2</cell>
					<cell>5</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</table>

		<p>
			You can follow the steps below by looking at the mean and standard deviation tab of the sample spreadsheet. If you are using Google Sheets, the example is found by <url href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_wnEQl5btBz6646XbhOrjyAYLRntf7dCunb-qRUJBDM/edit?usp=sharing">clicking here</url>. Note that this is a <alert>read-only</alert> file; to modify it, you have to make a copy for yourself.

			<dl>
			<li><title>Part 1: Enter the data</title>
			<p><ol>
				<li>Write headings VALUE, COUNT, PERCENT in A1, B1, C1.</li>
				<li><p>Enter the values, taking advantage of the fact that the values all differ by the same amount.
					<ol>
						<li>Write the score 0 in A2.</li>
						<li>Write =A2+1 in A3.</li>
						<li>Click the lower-right corner of cell A3 and drag down to enter scores 2 through 5 in A4 through A7.</li>
					</ol></p></li>
				<li>Write SUM in A9.</li>
				<li>Enter the counts in B2 through B7.</li>
				<li>Sum up the counts by writing “=sum(B2:B7)” (without the quotation marks) in B9.</li>
			</ol>
			</p></li>

			<li><title>Part 2: Make a bar graph of counts</title>
			<p><ol>
				<li>Highlight the counts (B2 through B7).</li>
				<li>Under the Insert menu, click “Chart”.</li>
				<li>It should have the option of a “column chart” selected as default; otherwise select it.</li>
				<li>On the right side of the screen, in the chart editor, click “add x-axis”.</li>
				<li>Select A2 to A7 (the values which go in the x-axis) and click ok.</li>
				<li>Under the “Customize” tab in chart editor, you can change the title and formatting options if you want.</li>
			</ol></p></li>

			<li><title>Part 3: Add data for percentages</title>
			<p><ol>
				<li>Compute the percentage for the first value by writing “=100*B2/B9” (without the quotation marks) in C2.</li>
				<li><p>We need to apply the same formula several times. Here is a way to make that easier.
					<ol>
						<li>Attempt to repeat the formula for the other values by dragging C2 down to C7.</li>
						<li>To see what went wrong, look at the formula that appeared in C3.  What should the correct formula be?</li>
						<li>Compute the correct percentages by changing the formula in C2 to “=100*B2/B$9” and repeating part (b).</li>
						<li>What does the $ do?</li>
					</ol></p></li>
				<li>Make column C easier to read by changing the number format. Highlight the whole column, then under the Format menu, go to the Number sub-menu (near the top) and select the option <q>Number</q>.</li>
			</ol></p></li>

			<li><title>Part 4: Make a bar graph of percentages</title>
			<p><ol>
				<li>Use Ctrl+click to select A2 to A7 and C2 to C7 at the same time.</li>
				<li>Repeat Part 2 with the new selection of data.</li>
			</ol></p></li>
