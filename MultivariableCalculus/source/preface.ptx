	<p>
		<em>Coordinated Multivariable Calculus</em> is adapted from
		<em>Active Calculus: Multivariable + Vector</em> by Steve Schlicker, Mitchel T.
		Keller,
		and Nicholas Long, originally released under a Creative Commons license.
		Much of the spirit of the original text is preserved, though we have added many
		worked examples and simplified some of the presentation.
		We have also trimmed the material to match the material of Math 208 at UNL;
		mostly we have moved the extra material to Extra Topic sections at the end of chapters,
		but in some cases we have eliminated the material entirely to avoid confusion to students.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is an ongoing project, and in the future we hope to add many more interactive graphics
		to assist students as they work through the text.
	</p>

	<p>
		For completeness we include below the preface to the Vector addition to
		<em>Active Calculus: Multivariable</em>.
