		<p permid="Thb">
			We have seen that we can use the first derivative of a function to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing,
			and the second derivative to know where the function is concave up or concave down.
			This information helps us determine the overall shape and behavior of the graph
			as well as whether the function has relative extrema.
			In this section we will explore when a function has an absolute maximum or minimum.

			<title>Absolute Maximum and Minimum</title>
			<p>
				Given a function <m>f</m>,
				we say that <m>f(c)</m> is an <term>
				absolute maximum</term>
				of <m>f</m> provided that
				<m>f(c) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.
				Similarly, we call <m>f(c)</m> an <term>absolute
				minimum</term>
				of <m>f</m> whenever <m>f(c) \le f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.
			</p>
		</assemblage>

		<p permid="zok">
			The difference between a relative maximum and an absolute maximum:
			there is a <em>relative</em> maximum of <m>f</m> at <m>x = c</m> if
			<m>f(c) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> <em>near</em> <m>c</m>,
			while there is an <em>absolute</em> maximum at <m>c</m> if
			<m>f(c) \ge f(x)</m> for <em>all</em>
			<m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.

			<p permid="GSJ">
				For instance, in <xref ref="F-3-3-Intro">Figure</xref> at the right,
				we see a function <m>f</m> that has an absolute maximum at <m>x = c</m> and a relative maximum at <m>x = a</m>,
				since <m>f(c)</m> is greater than or equal to <m>f(x)</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
				while <m>f(a)</m> is only greater than or equal to the value of <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>.
				Since the function appears to decrease without bound,
				<m>f</m> has no absolute minimum,
				although there is a relative minimum at <m>x = b</m>.

							<ol marker="a.">
								<li>
									<p>
										The graph shows that <m>h(x)\le-1=h(-2)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>-2</m> and
										<m>h(x)\le2=h(1)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>1</m>.
										We notice that these are points where <m>h</m>
										switches from increasing to decreasing.
										Since there are no other points on the graph where the
										<m>y</m>-coordinate is larger than everything nearby, it follows that the only relative
										maxima of <m>h</m> on this domain occur at <m>c=-2</m> and <m>c=1</m>.
									</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p>
										The graph shows that <m>h(x)\ge-2=h(0)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>0</m>, a point where
										<m>h</m> switches from decreasing to increasing.
										Since this is the only point shown where this occurs,
										we say that the only relative minimum of <m>h</m> on this domain occurs at <m>c=0</m>.
										<!--However, because we are looking at a restricted domain,
										on the left we see that <m>h</m> starts out by going up, so <m>h(x)\ge-3=h(-3)</m> for every <m>x</m> near to
										(and greater than) <m>-3</m>.
										Similarly, on the right we see that <m>h</m> finishes by going down,
										so <m>h(x)\ge-1.25=h(3)</m> for all <m>x</m> near to (and less than) <m>3</m>.
										At the very least, then,
										we can say that the relative minima of <m>h</m> <em>on the domain <m>[-3,3]</m></em> are
										<m>c=-3</m>, <m>c=0</m>, and <m>c=3</m>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Again, we emphasize that the endpoints of the domain are special.
										If the graph extended to either side,
										we could not say with certainty whether the points <m>(-3,h(-3))</m> and <m>(3,h(3))</m> are relative minima or not.
										They might be, if the graph changed direction again, but they would not be if the graph followed the existing trend.
										-->
									</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p>
										The highest point shown on the graph is the point <m>(1,2)</m>.
										Since <m>h</m> is
										continuous on <m>[-3,3]</m>, we don't have to worry about any points on the interval being higher and not
										showing up on the displayed grid.
										Hence we say the absolute maximum of <m>h</m> on the interval
										<m>[-3,3]</m> is <m>2</m> and occurs at <m>x=1</m>.
									</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p>
										The lowest point shown on the graph is the point <m>(-3,-3)</m>.
										Again, since <m>h</m> is
										continuous on <m>[-3,3]</m>, we don't have to worry about any points on the interval being lower
										and not showing up in the window that is displayed.
										Thus we say the absolute minimum of <m>h</m> on
										the interval <m>[-3,3]</m> is <m>-3</m> and occurs at <m>x=-3</m>.
									</p>

									<p>
										It is worth noting that this was not a point that we found as a local minimum.
										The difference
										is that here we are restricting our focus to the interval that is shown, effectively
										cutting off the graph at its endpoints.
										Earlier, when we were looking for relative
										minima, we made the assumption that the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> continues outside of the depicted
										interval by following the trends displayed and continuing downward on both sides.
									</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p>
										When looking for points <m>(c,h(c))</m> at which <m>h'(c)=0</m>, we are looking for
										points of horizontal tangency.
										The graph flattens out at <m>(-2.5,-2)</m> and <m>(1,2)</m>,
										but nowhere else<fn>
										Note that at <m>(1.5,1)</m> it looks as though the graph is flat to the right of this point.
										However,
										the derivative is undefined here because of the cusp, so this is not a point of horizontal tangency
										</fn>.
										Thus <m>h'(c)=0</m> exactly when <m>c=-2.5</m> and <m>c=1</m>.
									</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p>
										Recall that <m>h'(c)</m> only exists when all of the following are true:
										<ul>
											<li>
												<p>
													<m>h(c)</m> is defined,
												</p>
											</li>

											<li>
												<p>
													<m>\lim_{x\to c}h(x)</m> exists,
												</p>
											</li>

											<li>
												<p>
													<m>\lim_{x\to c}h(x)=h(c)</m>, and
												</p>
											</li>

											<li>
												<p>
													<m>\lim_{a\to0}\frac{h(c+a)-h(c)}a</m> exists.
												</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
										Assuming <m>h</m> is continuous at <m>c</m> (i.e.
										the first three points hold),
										the main consequence of the final point is that a corner or a cusp at <m>(c,h(c))</m>
										makes <m>h</m> non-differentiable at <m>c</m>.
									</p>

									<p>
										With all this in mind, we can say that <m>h'(c)</m> does not exist at <m>c=-2</m>, <m>c=0</m>, or <m>c=1.5</m>
										because <m>h</m> has a cusp at these points.
										<!-- Moreover, <m>h'(-3)</m> does not exist because
										<m>\lim_{a\to0^-}\frac{h(-3+a)-h(-3)}a</m> is undefined, and <m>h'(3)</m> does not
										exist because <m>\lim_{a\to0^+}\frac{h(3+a)-h(3)}a</m> is undefined.-->
									</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p>
										This is true.
										Every relative extremum of <m>h</m> occurs at a point where <m>h'(c)</m>
										is either zero or does not exist.
									</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p>
										This is false.
										Some points at which <m>h'(c)</m> is zero or undefined are not relative extrema.
										In particular, <m>h'(-2.5)</m> is zero, but the graph is non-decreasing near <m>(-2.5,-2)</m>.
										Similarly, <m>h'(1.5)</m> is undefined, but the graph is non-increasing near <m>(1.5,1)</m>.
										Neither of these points is a local maximum or minimum.

												Given <m>f(x)=x^4-98x^2+10</m>,

												<m>x=0</m>, <m>x=7</m> and <m>x=-7</m>.
											</p>

											<p>
												Since we are looking at the interval <m>-6\leq x\leq 15</m> we will only test the critical values within this interval, which are <m>x=0,7</m>.
											</p>

											<p>
												Now we plug in these two critical values, along with then endpoints <m>x=-6</m> and <m>x=15</m> to find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum:

												We first notice that the domain of <m>f</m> is all real numbers, since the denominator
												of <m>f(x)</m> is always at least <m>1</m>:
												<md>
													<mrow>(x+1)^2\ge\mathstrut\amp0</mrow>
													<mrow>1+(x+1)^2\ge\mathstrut\amp1</mrow>
												</md>.
												To differentiate <m>f</m>, we will first rewrite <m>f(x)</m> as
												<me>
													f(x)=2+3\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^{-1}
												</me>
												and then use the chain rule to find
												<md>
													<mrow>f'(x)=\mathstrut\amp3\left((-1)\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^{-2}\left(2(x+1)(1)\right)\right)</mrow>
													<mrow>=\mathstrut\amp\frac{-6(x+1)}{\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^2}</mrow>
												</md>.
												The denominator of <m>f'(x)</m> is always at least <m>1</m> for the same reason that
												the denominator of <m>f(x)</m> is always at least <m>1</m>, so there are no points
												<m>x=c</m> for which <m>f'(c)</m> does not exist.
												Thus the only critical number(s) of
												<m>f</m> will occur when <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
												This happens when
												<md>
													<mrow>-6(x+1)=\mathstrut\amp0</mrow>
													<mrow>x+1=\mathstrut\amp0</mrow>
													<mrow>x=\mathstrut\amp-1</mrow>
												</md>.
												Thus the only critical number of <m>f</m> is <m>c=-1</m>, with <m>f'(-1)=0</m>.
											</p>
										</li>

										<li>
											<p>
												As stated in (a), the denominator of <m>f'(x)</m> is always at least <m>1</m>, so in particular,
												it is always positive.
												On our first derivative sign chart, the only critical number we have is <m>c=-1</m>,
												which splits the domain of <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> into the intervals <m>(-\infty,-1)</m>
												and <m>(-1,\infty)</m>.
												Thinking of the factors of <m>f'(x)</m> as <m>-6</m>, <m>(x+1)</m>, and <m>\frac{1}{\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^2}</m>,
												the signs of these at <m>x=-2</m> are <q><m>--+</m></q>, with the final product positive.
												Likewise, the signs of these factors at <m>x=0</m> are <q><m>-++</m></q>, making the
												final product negative.
												Therefore <m>f'(x)\gt0</m> on the interval <m>x\lt-1</m>, and <m>f'(x)\lt0</m> on the
												interval <m>x\gt-1</m>.
												Hence <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>(-\infty,-1)</m> and decreasing on <m>(-1,\infty)</m>.
											</p>
										</li>

										<li>
											<p>
												According to the first derivative test, the point <m>(-1,f(-1))</m> is a relative
												maximum of <m>f</m>.
												Since this is the only critical point of the function and
												<m>f</m> is continuous everywhere, there is nowhere else that <m>f</m> can change
												direction.
												It follows that this point is actually an absolute maximum.
											</p>

											<p>
												From an algebraic standpoint, we have already observed that <m>1+(x+1)^2\ge1</m> for every
												value of <m>x</m>.
												Consequently,
												<me>
													0\lt\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le3
												</me>
												for every value of
												<m>x</m>, and this quotient achieves its maximum of <m>3</m> when <m>x=-1</m>.
												Hence
												<me>
													2\lt2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le5
												</me>
												for every value of <m>x</m>, so the maximum value that <m> f </m> can attain is <m> 5 </m>.
												Since <m>f(-1)=5</m>, we conclude that the absolute maximum of <m>f</m> is <m>5</m>
												at <m>x=-1</m>.
											</p>
										</li>

										<li>
											<p>
												The symmetry of <m>f</m> about <m>x=-1</m> allows us to compute both limits simultaneously.
												We first note that <m>\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)=\infty</m> and
												<m>\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{1}{1+(x+1)^2}=0</m>.
												Thus
												<me>
													\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left(2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\right)=2+0=2
												</me>.
												This tells us the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> has a horizontal asymptote of <m>y=2</m>.
											</p>
										</li>

										<li>
											<p>
												In (c), we stated the inequality
												<me>
													2\lt2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le5
												</me>.
												Since the quotient
												in the formula for <m>f(x)</m> is always strictly greater than zero, adding <m>2</m>
												to the quotient to obtain <m>f(x)</m> will always yield a value strictly greater
												than <m>2</m>.
											</p>
										</li>

										<li>
											<p>
												Since <m>f(x)\gt2</m> for every value of <m>x</m>, an absolute minimum of <m>f</m>
												(if it existed) would necessarily be larger than <m>2</m>.
												But we showed in (d) that
												<m>\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=2</m>, meaning that <m>f</m> gets arbitrarily close to
												<m>2</m> as <m>x</m> gets large.
												So, there is no value larger than <m> 2 </m> that is an absolute minimum for <m> f</m>, and thus <m> f </m> has no absolute minimum.
