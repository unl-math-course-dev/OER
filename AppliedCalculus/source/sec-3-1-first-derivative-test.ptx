			Simply put,
			an increasing function is one that is rising as we move from left to right along the graph (i.e.
			as the inputs increase),
			and a decreasing function is one that falls as we move left to right.
		</p>

		<p permid="YsX">
			Given a differentiable function <m>y= f(x)</m>,
			we know that its derivative, <m>y' = f'(x)</m>,
			is the function whose output at <m>x=a</m> tells us the slope of the tangent line to
			<m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
		</p>

		<p permid="EAg">
			At a point where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive,
			the slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> is positive.
			Therefore, on an interval where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive,
			the function <m>f</m> is increasing.
			<idx><h>increasing</h></idx>
			Similarly,
			if <m>f'(x)</m> is negative on an interval,

			An example of this can be seen in <xref ref="F-1-6-Intro">Figure</xref> below.
		</p>

		<p permid="kHp">
			The derivative of <m>f</m> tells us not only <em>whether</em>
			the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing on an interval,
			but also <em>how fast</em> the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing.
			Look at the two tangent lines shown below in <xref ref="F-1-6-Intro">Figure</xref>.
			We see that at point <m>A</m>
			the value of <m>f'(x)</m> is positive and relatively close to zero,
			and at that point the graph is rising slowly.
			By contrast, at point <m>B</m>,
			the derivative is negative and relatively large in absolute value,

				Let <m>f</m> be a function that is differentiable on an interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
				If the function <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>(a,b)</m> then
				<m>f'(x) \geq 0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval <m>(a, b)</m>.
				Conversely, if <m>f'(x) > 0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval, then
				the function <m>f</m> must be increasing on the interval.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that we have to have the derivative strictly positive to conclude that the function is increasing.
				Letting <m>f</m> be a constant function shows that if the derivative can be zero, then the function
				need not be increasing.
				Also, knowing the function is increasing is not enough to conclude that the
				derivative is strictly positive.
				The function <m>f(x)=x^3</m> is increasing on <m>(-1,1)</m> but <m>f'(0)=0</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Similarly, if the function <m>f</m> is decreasing on <m>(a,b)</m> then
				<m>f'(x) \leq 0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval <m>(a, b)</m>.
				Conversely, if <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval, then
				the function <m>f</m> must be decreasing on the interval.
			</p>

			<p permid="BFA">
				For example,
				the function pictured below in <xref ref="F-1-6-Intro2">Figure</xref>
				is increasing on the entire interval <m>-2 \lt x \lt 0</m>.
				Note that at both <m>x = \pm 2</m> and <m>x = 0</m>,
				we say that <m>f</m> is neither increasing nor decreasing,
				because <m>f'(x) = 0</m> at these values.

												We notice that these are points where <m>h</m>
												switches from increasing to decreasing.
												Since there are no other points on the graph where the
												<m>y</m>-coordinate is larger than everything nearby, it follows that the only relative

												The graph shows that <m>h(x)\ge-2=h(0)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>0</m>, a point where

												Since this is the only point shown where this occurs,
												we say that the only relative minimum of <m>h</m> on this domain occurs at <m>c=0</m>.
												<!--However, because we are looking at a restricted domain,
												on the left we see that <m>h</m> starts out by going up, so <m>h(x)\ge-3=h(-3)</m> for every <m>x</m> near to

										<em>Step 2.</em> Find any critical numbers of <m>s(t)</m> by (1) setting <m>s'(t)=0</m> and solving for <m>t</m> and (2) finding all values of <m>t</m> for which <m>s'(t)=DNE</m>.
										Let us consider (2) first.
										Since <m>s'(t)=-32t+24 </m> is defined everywhere, then there are no values of <m> t</m> for which <m>s'(t)=DNE</m>.
										So, we need only consider (1).
										Setting <m>s'(t)=0</m>, we have
										<me>
											-32t+24=0,
										</me>
										and subtracting <m>24</m> from both sides and dividing by <m>-32</m> gives
										<me>
											t= \frac{-24}{-32}=\frac{3}{4}.
										</me>
										Thus we found a single critical number <m>t=\frac{3}{4}</m>.
									</p>

									<p>
										<em>Step 3.</em> Consider the sign of the derivative on either side of the critical point to determine if the function is increasing or decreasing.
										In this case <m>s'(0)=24\gt0</m>, thus <m>s(t)</m> is increasing to the left of the critical point.
										Also <m>s'(1)=-8\lt0</m>, thus <m>s(t)</m> is decreasing to the right of critical point.
									</p>

									<p>
										<em>Step 4.</em> Interpret your results from Step 3.
										Since the function goes from increasing to decreasing at <m>t=\frac{3}{4}</m>, the function has a relative maximum at <m>(\frac{3}{4},s(\frac{3}{4}))</m> (shown on the <em>left</em> of <xref ref="F-3-1-Intro">Figure</xref>).

										<em>Step 1.</em> Find the derivative of <m>f(x)</m>.

										<em>Step 2.</em> Find any critical numbers of <m>f(x)</m> by (1) setting <m>f'(x)=0</m> and solving for <m>x</m> and (2) considering when <m>f'(x)=DNE</m>.
										Let us consider (2) first.
										Since <m> f'(x)=6x^2-6x-12
										</m> is defined everywhere, then there are no values of <m> x</m> for which <m>f'(x)=DNE</m>.
										So, we need only consider (1).
										Setting <m>f'(x)=0</m>, we have

										and factoring 6 out of the equation and factoring, we have

											6(x^2-x-2)=6(x-2)(x+1)=0.
										</me>
										So, there are two critical numbers <m>x=2,-1</m>.
									</p>

									<p>
										<em>Step 3.</em> Consider the sign of the derivative on either side of the critical points to determine if the function is increasing or decreasing.
										In this case we need to test the sign at three points: <m>f'(-2)=24\gt0</m>, thus <m>f(x)</m> is increasing when <m>x\lt-1</m>; <m>f(0)=-12\lt0</m>, thus <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing for <m> -1 \lt x \lt 2</m>; and <m>f'(3)=24\gt0</m>, thus <m>f(x)</m> is increasing for <m>x\gt 2</m>.
									</p>

									<p>
										<em>Step 4.</em> Interpret your results from Step 3.
										Since <m>f(x)</m> goes from  increasing to decreasing at <m>x=-1</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> has a relative maximum at <m>(-1,f(-1))</m>.

									<p permid="WiL">
										Since we already have <m>f'(x)</m> written in factored form,
										it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
										Because <m>f'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>,
										we need only determine where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
										From the equation
										<me permid="Afi">
											e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2 = 0
										</me>
										and the zero product property<fn>
										The zero product property says that if <m>ab=0</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are
										expressions representing real numbers (e.g.
										<m>a=(3-x)</m>, where <m>x</m> is a real number),
										then it must be the case that <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m> (or both).
										</fn>,
										it follows that <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = -1</m> are critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
										(There is no value of <m>x</m> that makes <m>e^{-2x} = 0</m>.)
									</p>

									<p permid="CpU">
										Next, to apply the first derivative test,
										we'd like to know the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> at inputs near the critical numbers.
										Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which <m>f'</m> can change sign,
										it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers:
										for instance,
										the sign of <m>f'</m> must be the same for every <m>x \lt -1</m>.
										What this means is that we can choose (carefully) where to evaluate the derivative
										in order to ascertain its sign on a given interval.
										Since <m>f'(-1.000001)</m> and
										<m>f'(-2)</m> must have the same sign, we may as well evaluate <m>f'(x)</m> at <m>-2</m>
										to figure out the sign of <m>f'</m> for <m>x\lt -1</m>.
										We create a first derivative sign chart (displayed below, with explanation following)
										to summarize the sign of <m>f'</m> on the relevant intervals,
										along with the corresponding behavior of <m>f</m>.

										</figure>

										<p permid="ixd">
											To produce the first derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart">Figure</xref>,
											we start by marking the critical numbers <m>-1</m> and <m>3</m> on the number line.
											We then identify the sign of each factor of <m>f'(x)</m> at one selected point in each interval.
											The intervals in this example are <m>x\lt-1</m>, <m>-1\lt x\lt3</m>, and <m>x\gt3</m>; we will choose
											<m>x=-2</m>, <m>x=0</m>, and <m>x=5</m> for our selected points.
											The process with <m>x=-2</m> is laid out below:
										</p>

										<p>
											For <m>x \lt -1</m>,
											we use the value <m>x=-2</m> to determine the sign of <m>e^{-2x}</m>,
											<m>(3-x)</m>, and <m>(x+1)^2</m>.
											We note that <m>e^{-2x}</m> is positive regardless of the value of <m>x</m>,
											<m>(x+1)^2</m> is positive whenever it is nonzero <mdash /> which is everywhere
											within the intervals of interest since we intentionally plucked out the zeros <mdash />
											and that <m>(3-x)</m> is also positive at <m>x = -2</m>.
											Hence each of the three terms in <m>f'</m> is positive,
											and we indicate this by writing <q><m>+++</m></q> above the interval <m>x\lt-1</m>.
											Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for <m>f'</m>,
											so we denote the sign of <m>f'</m> by a <q><m>+</m></q> above the appropriate interval in the chart.
											Finally, since <m>f'</m> is positive on that interval,
											we know that <m>f</m> is increasing,
											so we write <q>INC</q>
											to represent the behavior of <m>f</m>.
										</p>

										<p>
											In a similar fashion,
											we find that <m>f'</m> is positive (because <m>3-(0)\gt0</m> and the other terms are also still positive) and <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>-1 \lt x \lt 3</m>,
											and that <m>f'</m> is negative (because <m>3-(5)\lt0</m> but the other terms are still positive) and <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \gt 3</m>.
										</p>

										<p permid="OEm">
											Now we look for critical numbers at which <m>f'</m> changes sign.
											In this example, <m>f'</m> changes sign only at <m>x = 3</m>,
											from positive to negative,
											so <m>f</m> has a relative maximum at <m>x = 3</m>.
											Although <m>f</m> has a critical number at <m>x = -1</m>,
											since <m>f</m> is increasing both before and after <m>x = -1</m>,
											<m>f</m> has neither a minimum nor a maximum at <m>x = -1</m>.
