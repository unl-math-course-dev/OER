		<title>The Product Rule</title>
		<p permid="DgF">
			As part (b) of <xref ref="PA-2-3">Example</xref> shows,
			it is not true in general that the derivative of a product of two functions is the product of the derivatives of those functions.
			To see why this is the case,
			we consider a situation involving functions with physical context.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="stock-share">
			<p permid="jnO">
				Say that an investor is regularly purchasing stock in a particular company.
				Let <m>N(t)</m> represent the number of shares owned on day <m>t</m>,
				where <m>t = 0</m> represents the first day on which shares were purchased.
				Let <m>S(t)</m> give the value of one share of the stock on day <m>t</m>;
				note that the units on <m>S(t)</m> are dollars per share.
				To compute the total value of the stock on day <m>t</m>,
				we take the product
				<me permid="mSo">
					V(t) = N(t) \, \text{shares}  \cdot S(t) \, \text{dollars per share}
				</me>,
				Observe that over time,
				both the number of shares and the value of a given share will vary.
				The derivative <m>N'(t)</m> measures the rate at which the number of shares is changing,
				while <m>S'(t)</m> measures the rate at which the value per share is changing.
				How do these respective rates of change affect the rate of change of the total value function?
			</p>

			<p permid="PuX">
				To help us understand the relationship among changes in <m>N</m>,
				<m>S</m>, and <m>V</m>, let's consider some specific data.
				<ul permid="uSm">
					<li permid="fJo">
						Suppose that on day 100,
						the investor owns 520 shares of stock and the stock's current value is $27.50 per share.
						This tells us that <m>N(100) = 520</m> and <m>S(100) = 27.50</m>.
					</li>

					<li permid="LQx">
						On day 100,
						the investor purchases an additional 12 shares
						(so the number of shares held is rising at a rate of 12 shares per day).
					</li>

					<li permid="rXG">
						On that same day the price of the stock is rising at a rate of 0.75 dollars per share per day.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p permid="vCg">
				In calculus notation, the latter two facts tell us
				that <m>N'(100) = 12</m>
				(shares per day)
				and <m>S'(100) = 0.75</m>
				(dollars per share per day).
				At what rate is the value of the investor's total holdings changing on day 100?
			</p>

			<p permid="bJp">
				Observe that the increase in total value comes from two sources:
				the growing number of shares
				and the rising value of each share.
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							If only the number of shares is increasing
							(and the value of each share is constant),
							the rate at which the total value would rise is the product of the rate at which the number of shares is changing and the current value of the shares.
							That is, the rate at which the total value would change when the share value is constant is given by
							<me permid="SZx">
								N'(100) \cdot S(100) =  12 \, \frac{\text{shares}}{\text{day}} \cdot 27.50 \, \frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{share}} = 330 \, \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{day} }
							</me>.
						</p>

						<p permid="HQy">
							Note particularly how the units make sense and show the rate at which the total value <m>V</m> is changing,
							measured in dollars per day.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p permid="nXH">
							If instead the number of shares is constant,
							but the value of each share is rising,
							the rate at which the total value would rise is  the product of the number of shares and the rate of change of share value.
							In this case, the total value is rising at a rate of
							<me permid="zgG">
								N(100) \cdot S'(100) = 520 \, \text{shares}  \cdot 0.75 \, \frac{\text{dollars per share} }{\text{day} } = 390 \, \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{day} }
							</me>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p permid="UeQ">
							Of course, when both the number of shares and the value of each share are changing,
							we have to include both of these sources.
							In that case the rate at which the total value is rising is
							<me permid="fnP">
								V'(100) =  N'(100) \cdot S(100) + N(100) \cdot S'(100) = 330 + 390 = 720 \, \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{day} }
							</me>.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p permid="AlZ">
				We expect the total value of the investor's holdings to rise by about $720 on the 100th day.<fn>
				While this example highlights why the product rule is true,
				there are some subtle issues to recognize.
				For one, if the stock's value really does rise exactly $0.75 on day 100,
				and the number of shares really rises by 12 on day 100,
				then we would expect that <m>V(101) = N(101) \cdot S(101) = 532 \cdot 28.25 = 15,029</m>.
				If, as noted above,
				we expect the total value to rise by $720,
				then with <m>V(100) = N(100) \cdot S(100) = 520 \cdot 27.50 = 14,300</m>,
				then it seems we should find that <m>V(101) = V(100) + 720 = 15,020</m>.
				Why do the two results differ by 9?
				One way to understand why this difference occurs is to recognize that <m>N'(100) = 12</m> represents an
				<em>instantaneous</em> rate of change,
				while our (informal) discussion has also thought of this number as the total change in the number of shares over the course of a single day.
				The formal proof of the product rule reconciles this issue by taking the limit as the change in the input tends to zero.
				</fn>

		<p permid="gti">
			Next, we expand our perspective from the specific example above to the more general and abstract setting of a product <m>P</m> of two differentiable functions,
			<m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
			If <m>P(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)</m>,
			our work above suggests that <m>P'(x) = f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x)</m>.
			Indeed, a formal proof using the limit definition of the derivative can be given to show that the following rule,
			called the <term>product rule</term>,
			holds in general.

				If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable functions,

			</p>
		</assemblage>

		<p permid="sHA">
			In light of <xref ref="stock-share">Example</xref> involving shares of stock,
			the product rule also makes sense intuitively:
			the rate of change of <m>P</m> should take into account both how fast <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are changing,
			as well as how large <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are at the point of interest.
			In words, the product rule says:
			if <m>P</m> is the product of two functions <m>f</m>
			(the first function)
			and <m>g</m>
			(the second),
			then <q>the derivative of <m>P</m> is the derivative of the first times the second,
			plus the first times the derivative of the second.</q>
			It is often a helpful mental exercise to say this phrasing aloud when executing the product rule.

					Our first task is to recognize the structure of the function.
					This function <m>f</m> is a sum of two slightly less complicated functions,

					When taking a derivative that involves the use of multiple derivative rules,
					it is often helpful to use the notation
					<m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[ ~~\right]</m> to wait to apply subsequent rules.
					This is demonstrated in both <xref ref="deriv-pq-1">Example</xref> and <xref ref="deriv-pq-2">Example</xref>,

				<p>
					Now, the left-hand term above is a product,
