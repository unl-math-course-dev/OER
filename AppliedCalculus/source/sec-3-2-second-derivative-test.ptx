		<p permid="Vds">
			We have seen how the first derivative of a function can help us determine when a function is increasing or decreasing.
			We have also seen how we can use that information to determine when a function reaches a maximum or minimum point.
			We will now explore what the second derivative of a function tells us.

		<title>Concavity</title>
		<p permid="Gpt">
			In addition to asking <em>whether</em>
			a function is increasing or decreasing,
			it is also natural to inquire <em>how</em>
			a function is increasing or decreasing.
			There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval,
			as pictured below in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>:
			the function can increase more and more rapidly,
			it can increase at the same rate,
			or it can increase in a way that is slowing down.
			Fundamentally,
			we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends,
			with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all.
			More than this,
			we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.
		</p>

			<caption>Three functions that are all increasing, but doing so at an increasing rate, at a constant rate, and at a decreasing rate, respectively.</caption>
			<image width="100%" source="1_6_3optsi" />
			</figure>

			<p permid="mwC">
				On the leftmost curve in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>,
				draw a sequence of tangent lines to the curve.
				As we move from left to right,
				the slopes of those tangent lines will increase.
				Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing,
				and this explains why we say this function is
				<em>increasing at an increasing rate</em>.
				For the rightmost graph in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>,
				observe that as <m>x</m> increases,
				the function increases, but the slopes of the tangent lines decrease.
				This function is <em>increasing at a decreasing rate</em>.
			</p>

			<p permid="SDL">
				Similar options hold for how a function can decrease.
				Here we must be extra careful with our language,
				because decreasing functions involve negative slopes.<fn>
				Negative numbers present an interesting tension between common language and mathematical language.
				For example, it can be tempting to say that
				<q><m>-100</m> is bigger than <m>-2</m>.</q>
				But we must remember that <q>greater than</q>
				describes how numbers lie on a number line:
				<m>x \gt y</m> provided that <m>x</m> lies to the right of <m>y</m>.
				So of course, <m>-100</m> is less than <m>-2</m>.
				Informally, it might be helpful to say that
				<q><m>-100</m> is more negative than <m>-2</m>.</q>
				</fn>

				<caption>From left to right, three functions that are all decreasing, but doing so in different ways.</caption>
				<image width="100%" source="1_6_3optsd" />
				</figure>

				<p permid="yKU">
					Now consider the three graphs shown above in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsd">Figure</xref>.
					The middle graph depicts a function decreasing at a constant rate.
					Now draw a sequence of tangent lines on the first curve.
					We see that the slopes of these lines get closer to zero <mdash /> meaning they get
					less and less negative <mdash /> as we move from left to right.
					That means that the values of the first derivative,
					while all negative, are increasing,
					and thus we say that the leftmost curve is
					<em>decreasing at an increasing rate</em>.
				</p>

				<p permid="eSd">
					This leaves only the rightmost curve in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsd">Figure</xref> to consider.
					For that function,
					the slopes of the tangent lines are negative throughout the pictured interval,
					but as we move from left to right,
					the slopes get more and more negative as they get steeper.
					Hence the slope of the curve is decreasing,
					and we say that the function is
					<em>decreasing at a decreasing rate</em>.
				</p>

				<p permid="KZm">
					We now introduce the notion of <em>concavity</em>,
					<idx><h>concavity</h></idx>
					which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors.
					When a curve opens upward on a given interval,
					like the parabola <m>y = x^2</m> or the exponential growth function <m>y = e^x</m>,
					we say that the curve is <em>concave up</em> on that interval.
					Likewise, when a curve opens down,
					like the parabola <m>y = -x^2</m> or the negative exponential function <m>y = -e^{x}</m>,
					we say that the function is <em>concave down</em>.
					Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.
				</p>

				<p permid="rgv">
					In <xref ref="F-1-6-concavity">Figure</xref> below,
					we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each.
					The lefthand plot shows a function that is concave up; observe that here the tangent lines
					always lie below the curve itself, and the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing
					as we move from left to right.
					In other words,
					the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative,
					<m>f'</m>, is increasing on that interval.
					Similarly, the righthand plot in <xref ref="F-1-6-concavity">Figure</xref>
					depicts a function that is concave down;
					in this case, we see that the tangent lines always lie above the curve
					and that the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right.
					The fact that its derivative,
					<m>f'</m>, is decreasing makes <m>f</m> concave down on the interval shown.

						<title>The Second Derivative Test</title>

							Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us several important things about the behavior of the function itself.

							This also tells us that throughout that interval the tangent line to

							As seen in <xref ref="F-3-1-2Dtest">Figure</xref> below, at a point where <m>f'(c) = 0</m>,

								In the event that <m>f''(c) = 0</m>,

							<p permid="jgX">
								Just as a first derivative sign chart reveals all of the increasing and decreasing behavior of a function,

							<example xml:id="Ex-3-2" permid="Xoe">
								<statement>
									<p permid="oWj">
										Let <m>f</m> be a function whose first derivative is <m>f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2</m>.

										identify all relative extreme values;
										and sketch a possible graph of <m>f</m>.
									</p>
								</statement>

								<solution permid="Ifg">
									<p permid="aSE">
										Since we know <m>f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2</m>,
										we can find the critical numbers of <m>f</m> by solving <m>3x^4 - 9x^2 = 0</m> (since <m> f' </m> exists everywhere, then there are no critical numbers for which <m>f'(x) = DNE</m>.
										Factoring, we observe that
										<me permid="gmr">
											0 = 3x^2(x^2 - 3) = 3x^2(x+\sqrt{3})(x-\sqrt{3})
										</me>,
										so that <m>x = 0, \pm\sqrt{3}</m> are the three critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
										The first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m> is given below in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart2">Figure</xref>.

										</figure>

										<p permid="GZN">
											We see that <m>f</m> is increasing on the intervals
											<m>(-\infty, -\sqrt{3})</m> and <m>(\sqrt{3}, \infty)</m>,
											and <m>f</m> is decreasing on
											<m>(-\sqrt{3},0)</m> and <m>(0, \sqrt{3})</m>.
											By the first derivative test,
											this information tells us that <m>f</m> has a local maximum at
											<m>x = -\sqrt{3}</m> and a local minimum at <m>x = \sqrt{3}</m>.
											Although <m>f</m> also has a critical number at <m>x = 0</m>,
											neither a maximum nor minimum occurs there since <m>f'</m> does not change sign at <m>x = 0</m>.
										</p>

										<p permid="ngW">
											Next, we move on to investigate concavity.
											Differentiating <m>f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2</m>,
											we see that <m>f''(x) = 12x^3 - 18x</m>.
											Since we are interested in knowing the intervals on which <m>f''</m> is positive and negative,
											we first find where <m>f''(x) = 0</m>.
											Observe that
											<me permid="MtA">
												0 = 12x^3 - 18x = 12x\left(x^2 - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 12x\left(x+\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\left(x-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)
											</me>.
											This equation has solutions <m>x = 0, \pm\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}</m>.
											Building a sign chart for <m>f''</m> in the exact same way we do for <m>f'</m>,
											we see the result shown below in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart3">Figure</xref>.

											<p permid="Tof">
												Therefore <m>f</m> is concave down on the intervals
												<m>\left(-\infty, -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)</m> and <m>\left(0, \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)</m>,

											<p permid="zvo">
												Putting all of this information together,

												<p permid="fCx">
													The point <m>A = (-\sqrt{3}, f(-\sqrt{3}))</m> is a local maximum,
													because <m>f</m> is increasing prior to <m>A</m> and decreasing after;

													Note, too, that <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>A</m> and concave up at <m>E</m>,
													which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test.
													At points <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>, concavity changes,
													as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart3">Figure</xref>.
													Finally, at point <m>C</m>,
													<m>f</m> has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line,
													but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there,
													since <m>f</m> is decreasing both before and after <m>C</m>.
													It is also the case that concavity changes at <m>C</m>.

												<p permid="LJG">
													While we completely understand where <m>f</m> is increasing and decreasing,
													where <m>f</m> is concave up and concave down,
													and where <m>f</m> has relative extrema,
													we do not know any specific information about the <m>y</m>-coordinates of points on the curve.
													For instance,
													while we know that <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -\sqrt{3}</m>,
													we don't know the value of that maximum because we do not know <m>f(-\sqrt{3})</m>.
