				<em>This section corresponds to</em>  4.6 Consumer Producer Surplus <em>in the workbook.</em> 
			</p>

		<p>
			It is of interest to both consumers and producers to know the best <em>price</em> to buy or sell a product.
			Let us consider the demand curve, <m>p=D(x)</m>, the price per unit that a consumer is willing to pay for <m>x</m> units of a product, and the supply curve, <m>p=S(x)</m>, the price per unit that the producer is willing to accept for the sale of <m>x</m> units.
		</p>

		<p>
			As the number of units <m>x</m> that are produced and sold increases, the demand curve, <m>D(x)</m> decreases.
			This is because consumers expect to pay less per unit for large quantities of the product.
			At a small scale, you can see this anytime you visit the grocery store: the price per unit when you buy a single item is almost always much more than the price per item when you buy in bulk.
			Graphically, <m>D(x)</m> is represented as a decreasing function.
		</p>

		<p>
			As the number of units <m>x</m>  that are produced and sold increases, the supply curve, <m>S(x)</m> increases.
			This is because a higher price per unit sold is an incentive for the producer to make more units available for sale.
			Graphically, <m>S(x)</m> is represented by an increasing function.
			The <em>equilibrium point (Q,P)</em> is the point at which the supply meets demand, or the point of intersection of the curves <m>S(x)=D(x)</m>.

			<p permid="vYs">
				Some consumers are willing to spend more on a product than the equilibrium price.
				The total difference between the equilibrium price of an item and the higher price a consumer is willing to spend is call the <em> Consumer Surplus</em> at the equilibrium and is the area between the curves <m>D(x)</m> and the horizontal line <m>y=P</m>, the equilibrium price (see <xref ref="F-4-5-1">Figure </xref>).
			</p>

			<p>
				Similarly, some producers are willing to sell a product at a price lower than the equilibrium price.
				The total difference between the equilibrium price of the item and lower price producers are willing to accept is called the <em> Producer Surplus</em> at the equilibrium.
				This is also an area between two curves: the horizontal line <m>y=P</m> and the supply curve, <m>S(x)</m>, (see <xref ref="F-4-5-1">Figure </xref>).

				<p>
					In Section 4.4 we saw that the area between two curves, <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>, can be determined by the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_a^b \left(f(x)-g(x)\right)dx</m>, where <m>g(x)</m> has y-values below <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
					Since the producer and consumer surpluses are represented by areas between two curves, then we can use integration to calculate these values.

					<title>Consumer Producer Surplus</title>
					<p>
						Let <m>p=D(x)</m> describe the demand function for a product and <m>p=S(x)</m> be the supply function for the same product.
						The equilibrium point <m>(Q,P)</m> is the point where <m>D(x)=S(x)</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Consumer Surplus at the equilibrium point is:
						<me>
							\int\limits_0^Q \left(D(x)-P\right) dx=\int\limits_0^Q D(x) dx-QP
						</me>
					</p>

					<p>
						The Producer Surplus at the equilibrium point is:
						<me>
							\int\limits_0^Q \left(P-S(x)\right) dx=QP-\int\limits_0^Q S(x) dx
						</me>
					</p>
				</assemblage>

				<example xml:id="example-one">
					<statement>
						<p>
							Suppose the supply function for selling <m>x</m> units is given by the equation <m>\displaystyle S(x)=250+5x</m>; the demand function for <m>x</m> units is given by <m>\displaystyle D(x)=1000-10x</m>.
							Find the producer and consumer surplus and explain what they represent.
						</p>

						<p>
							<em> Solution:</em> The first step is to find the equilibrium quantity, <m>Q</m>.
							To do this we set <m>S(x)=D(x)</m> and solve for <m>x</m>:
							<me>
								250+5x=1000-10x \implies 15x=750 \implies x=50
							</me>
							That is the equilibrium quantity is <m>Q=50</m> units sold.
						</p>

						<p>
							Next find the equilibrium price, <m>P</m> by plugging in <m>x=50</m> into either <m>S(x)</m> or <m>D(x)</m>.
							<me>
								S(50)=250+5(50)=500
							</me>
							And
							<me>
								D(50)=1000-10(50) = 500.
							</me>
							Thus the equilibrium price is <m>P=\$500</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							The consumer surplus is
							<me>
								\int\limits_0^Q \left(D(x)-P\right)dx=\int\limits_0^{50} \left(1000-10x-500\right)dx=\int\limits_0^{50} \left(500-10x\right)dx
							</me>
							<me>
								=\left.\left(500x-\frac{10x^2}{2}\right)\right|_0^{50}=\left(500(50)-5(50)^2)\right)-0=\$12500
							</me>
							Thus the advantage to the consumer who buys at the equilibrium price is <m>\$12,500</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Producer Surplus is
							<me>
								\int\limits_0^Q \left(P-S(x)\right)dx=\int\limits_0^{50} \left(500-(250+5x)\right)dx=\int\limits_0^{50}\left(250-5x\right)dx
							</me>
							<me>
								=\left.\left(250x-\frac{5x^2}{2}\right)\right|_0^{50}=\left(250(50)-\frac{5(50)^2}{2}\right)-0=\$6250
							</me>
							This means that the producer will have additional income of <m>\$6,250</m> if they sell their product at the equilibrium price.

								If we let <m> p = D(x) </m> be the demand curve and <m> p = S(x) </m> be the supply curve, then the <em> equilibrium point  </em> is the point <m> (Q, P) </m>  at which the supply meets demand; in other words, where <m> S(x) = D(x) </m>.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								The <em> consumer surplus  </em> is the difference between the equilibrium price of an item and the higher price that a consumer is willing to spend.
								This is also the area between the curves <m> D(x) </m> and the horizontal line <m> y=P </m>.
								We can use integration to calculate this area, so the consumer surplus at the equilibrium point is <m> \int_0^Q D(x)dx - QP </m>.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								The <em> producer surplus  </em> is the difference between the equilibrium price of an item and the lower price at which a producer is willing to sell that item.
								This is also the area between the curves <m> S(x) </m> and the horizontal line <m> y=P </m>.
								As with the consumer surplus, we can use integration to calculate this area, so the producer surplus at the equilibrium point is <m>QP -  \int_0^Q S(x)dx  </m>.
