			<title>Profit, Revenue and Cost</title>
			<p>
				First,  let us explore some key relationships between Profit, Revenue and Cost functions.
				Given a price-demand function <m>p(x)</m>, where <m>p(x)</m> is the price per unit when selling <m>x</m> units, the total revenue from the sale of <m>x</m> units is:
				<me>
					R(x)=xp(x).
				</me>
				In words, the total revenue is the product of the number of items sold <m>(x)</m> times the price per item <m>p(x)</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Given <m>C(x)</m>, the total cost to produce <m>x</m> items, the total profit from the sale of <m>x</m> items is
				<me>
					P(x)=R(x)-C(x).
				</me>
				In words, the total profit is the revenue minus the cost.
			</p>
		</assemblage>

		<example xml:id="Opt-Buis-1" permid="svs">
			<statement>
				<p permid="zZR">
					A company reports that the cost of producing <m>x</m> automobiles weekly is given by
					<me permid="juF">
						C(x) = 5x + x^2.
					</me>
					The company's price-demand function is given by
					<me permid="juF">
						p(x) = 145 - x.
					</me>
					How many automobiles must be produced and sold to maximize profit? What is the maximum profit?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<answer>
				<p>
					The maximum profit is <m>\$3675.</m>
				</p>
			</answer>

			<solution>
				<p>
					To find the maximum profit first we need to determine the profit function.
					<me>
						P(x)=R(x)-C(x)
					</me>
					The cost function is given, but we need to find the revenue function, which is given by
					<me>
						R(x)=xp(x)=x(145-x)=145x-x^2.
					</me>
					Therefore,
					<me>
						P(x)=145x-x^2-(5x+x^2)=140x-2x^2.
					</me>.
					Since the number of units <m> x </m> cannot be negative, then the domain of the profit function is <m> [0, \infty) </m>.
					Since <m> P(x) </m> is a parabola which faces down, then there is only one critical point, which is the vertex of the parabola, and it is an absolute maximum.
					To find this critical point, we find the derivative of the profit function and set it equal to 0:
					<me>
						P'(x)=140-4x=0 \implies x=140/4=35.
					</me>
					From our reasoning in the previous paragraph, this should be a maximum for the function <m> P(x) </m>.
					To confirm this, we can use the second derivative test.
					Since
					<me>
						P''(x)=-4 \lt 0,
					</me>
					then the second derivative test tells us that <m>x=35</m> is a relative maximum.
					Again, since <m> P(x) </m> is a parabola which is facing down, then this is an absolute maximum, and thus the maximum profit is
					<me>
						P(35)=140(35)-2(35)^2=3675.
					</me>

					How many suits must the company produce and sell to maximize their profit?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<answer>
				<p>
					The company must produce and sell <m>100</m> suits to maximize profit.
				</p>
			</answer>

			<solution>
				<p>
					To find the maximum profit first we need to determine the profit function.
					<me>
						P(x)=R(x)-C(x)
					</me>
					The cost function is given, but we need to find the revenue function, which is given by
					<me>
						R(x)=xp(x)=x(150-0.5x)=150x-0.5x^2.
					</me>
					Therefore
					<me>
						P(x)=150x-0.5x^2-(4000+0.25x^2)=-0.75x^2+150x-4000.
					</me>.
					Since the number of units <m> x </m> cannot be negative, then the domain of the profit function is <m> [0, \infty) </m>.
					Since <m> P(x) </m> is a parabola which faces down, then there is only one critical point, which is the vertex of the parabola, and it is an absolute maximum.
					To find this critical point, we find the derivative of the profit function and set it equal to 0:
					<me>
						P'(x)=-1.5x+150=0 \implies x=100.
					</me>
					From our reasoning in the previous paragraph, this should be a maximum for the function <m> P(x) </m>.
					To confirm this, we can use the second derivative test.
					Since
					<me>
						P''(x)=-1.5\lt 0,
					</me>
					then the second derivative test tells us that <m>x=100</m> is a relative maximum.
					Again, since <m> P(x) </m> is a parabola which is facing down, then this is an absolute maximum, and thus the company must produce and sell <m>100</m> suits to maximize profit.

						<em>Draw a picture and introduce variables.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables.
						Drawing a picture with these variables labeled is a particularly helpful way to accomplish this;
						in some cases, drawing several pictures might be useful.
						A nice example of this can be seen at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/99">http://gvsu.edu/s/99</url>,
						where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li permid="Phc">
					<p permid="Mmw">
						<em>Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced:
						one equation will represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought;
						there may be additional equations showing how multiple variables in the problem are interrelated.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li permid="vol">
					<p permid="stF">
						<em>Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						It may be necessary to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula
						using the secondary equations that were found in the previous step.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li permid="bvu">
					<p permid="YAO">
						<em>Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on.
						Thinking back to the picture that describes the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li permid="HCD">
					<p permid="EHX">
						<em>Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first.
						Then depending on the domain,
						we either construct a first derivative sign chart
						(for an open or unbounded interval)
						or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers
						(for a closed, bounded interval).
					</p>
				</li>

				<li permid="nJM">
					<p permid="kPg">
						<em>Finally, we make certain we have answered the question that was posed.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						Does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity,
						or do we need the values of the variables that produce the maximum?
						In other words,
						finding the maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that yield that volume.
					</p>
				</li>

			The remaining examples involve a variety of quantities to be optimized.
			Each task presents an opportunity to practice the above steps, possibly with some

					<p>
						If we call the width <m>x</m> and the length <m>y</m> then we want to find the maximum area
						<me>
							A=xy.
						</me>
						Since we have two variables, we need a second equation.
						Here we note that we have <m> 180 </m> feet of rope, so we determine an equation for total rope:
						<me>
							P=180=2x+y \implies y=180-2x.
						</me>
						Then substituting back into the first equation, we have
						<me>
							A=x(180-2x)=180x-2x^2.
						</me>
						We now wish to find the absolute maximum of the function <m> A </m> on its domain.
						Recall that <m> x </m> represents the width of the swimming area.
						So, <m> x </m> must be nonnegative.
						Similarly, since <m> y = 180-2x </m> represents the length of the swimming area, then <m> y </m> must be nonnegative, so <m> x </m> must be less than or equal to 90.
						Therefore, the domain of  <m> A </m> is  <m>[0,90]</m>.
						To find the absolute maximum of <m> A </m>, we first find the derivative and set it equal to zero:
						<me>
							A'(x)=180-4x=0 \implies x=180/4=45.
						</me>
						Then since
						<me>
							A''(x)=-4 \lt 0
						</me>
						This is the maximum.
						Note that we have only found the width, so we also need to find the length, which we find by plugging <m> x = 45 </m> into the equation for <m> y </m>:
						<me>
							y=180-2(45)=90.
						</me>
						Thus the maximum area is <m>A=45(90)=4050</m> square feet, and the dimensions are width <m>45</m> feet  and length <m>90</m> feet.

							If we call the width <m>x</m> and the length <m>y</m> then we want to find the minimum perimeter
							<me>

							Since we have two variables we need a second equation.
							Here we note that we wish to enclose a total area of <m>12800</m> square meters, thus the area equation is:
							<me>
								A=12800=xy \implies y=\frac{12800}{x}
							</me>
							Then substituting back into the first equation
							<me>
								P(x)=2x+\frac{12800}{x}
							</me>
							We now wish to find the absolute maximum on the domain of <m> P </m>.
							Since the width <m> x </m> must be positive, then the domain for <m> P </m> is <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
							To find the maximum, we find the derivative and set it equal to zero:
							<me>
								P'(x)=2-\frac{12800}{x^2}=0 \implies 2=\frac{12800}{x^2} \implies x^2=\frac{12800}{2}=6400

																We are asked to maximize the volume of the box.
																Since the box has a square end with
																side length <m>x</m> inches and is <m>y</m> inches long, the volume formula is
																<me>
																	V=x^2y
																</me>,
																measured in cubic inches.
															</p>
														</li>

														<li>
															<p>
																We are working under the assumption that the square end is the smallest end, which
																means the perimeter of the square face will be the girth and the other side will
																be the length.
																This yields the relation
																<me>
																	4x+y=108
																</me>.
																We note again that we have
																the assumed constraint <m>x\le y</m>.
															</p>
														</li>

														<li>
															<p>
																Since <m>4x+y=108</m>, we can say that <m>y=108-4x</m>.
															</p>
														</li>

														<li>
															<p>
																Since <m>V=x^2y</m> and <m>y=108-4x</m>, an alternate expression for the parcel's
																volume is
																<me>
																	V(x)=x^2(108-4x)=108x^2-4x^3
																</me>.
															</p>
														</li>

														<li>
															<p>
																We know that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> must both be positive, so we have <m>0\lt x,y</m>.
																Additionally, from above, we also have the constraint that <m>x\le y</m>.
																Finally, since <m>4x+y=108</m> and <m>x\le y</m>, it must be the case that
																<m>5x\le4x+y=108</m>, so <m>x\le 108/5=21.6</m>.
																Likewise, since <m>x</m> is positive, we must
																have <m>y\lt 108</m>.
																In sum, we have the intervals:
																<me>
																	0\lt x\le21.6 \text{ and }x\le y\lt108
																</me>.
															</p>
														</li>

														<li>
															<p>
																We now need to maximize the function <m>V(x)=108x^2-4x^3</m> on the interval <m>(0,21.6]</m>.
																We begin by differentiating <m>V</m>, finding
																<me>
																	V'(x)=216x-12x^2=12x(18-x)
																</me>.
																As <m>V'(x)</m> is a polynomial, it is defined everywhere; to find the critical numbers
																of <m>V</m>, then, we need only solve the equation <m>V'(x)=0</m>.
																Doing so yields the critical numbers <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=18</m>.
																On the interval
																<m>0\lt x\le 21.6</m>, the only critical number is <m>18</m>.
															</p>

															<p>
																We can use the first derivative test to check that this is a maximum.
																Using the first derivative test, we have <m>V'(x)\gt0</m>
																for <m>0\lt x\lt 18</m> and <m>V'(x)\lt0</m> for <m>18\lt x \le 21.6</m>.
																Thus <m>V(18)</m> is
																a relative maximum and, on the interval <m>(0,21.6]</m>.
																Also, V increases from <m> x=0 </m> up to <m> x=18 </m>, and then decreases from <m> x=18 </m> to <m> x=21.6 </m>, so this is an absolute maximum on the interval <m> (0, 21.6] </m>.
															</p>

															<p>
																So, we have firmly established that the maximum volume occurs when <m>x=18</m>.
																This coincides
																with the length <m>y=108-4(18)=36</m> and the volume <m>V=(18)^2(36)=11,664</m>.
																Therefore the maximum volume
																of a parcel with a square end (provided that end is the smallest end of the box<fn>
																It turns out that when we assume the square end is the larger end, we end up with
																the dimensions <m>24\times24\times18</m> and a volume of <m>10,368\text{ in}^3</m>,
																so our process did indeed find the maximum volume of a parcel with a square end.</fn>) subject
																to the dimension constraints of the USPS is <m>11,664</m> cubic inches.
																This volume

										<solution permid="cEN">
											<p permid="ZKh">
												Let <m>x</m> be the length of one side of the square bottom and <m>h</m> the height of one of the sides.
												We first note that the volume, <m>V</m>,
												of the box is <m>V = x^2 h</m>,
												and the surface area of the box is <m>S = 2x^2 +  4xh</m>,
												since there are two square sides
												(bottom and top)

												Since the material for the top and bottom costs $3.00 per square foot and the material for the sides costs $1.50 per square foot,

											</p>

											<p permid="FRq">
												We are interested in building box of largest volume for which we spend $15.
												This cost constraint implies that
												<me permid="JvQ">

												which allows us to express <m>h</m> as a function of <m>x</m> by solving for <m>h</m>.
												Doing so, we see that <m>12xh = 15 - 3x^2</m>, so
												<me permid="pCZ">

												Using this relationship, we are now able to express the volume,

												Note particularly that in order to have a box,

												<p permid="eua">
													In the case of the fencing option on the left in the figure,

													To find the maximum value of <m>A</m> on this domain,

													Since <m>A'(y) = 3750 - 5y</m>,

														on the interval <m>0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}</m>,
														we see that for <m>0 \lt r \lt 5.147</m>,
														<m>C'(r) \lt 0</m>,
														and for <m>5.147 \lt r \lt 9.086</m>, <m>C'(r) \gt 0</m>,
														which shows that <m>C</m> is decreasing before the critical number and increasing after the critical number,
														and hence <m>C</m> has a global minimum of <m>C(\sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}}) \approx 1165.70</m>,
														so $1165.70 is the minimum cost to build the desired tank under the given constraints.
