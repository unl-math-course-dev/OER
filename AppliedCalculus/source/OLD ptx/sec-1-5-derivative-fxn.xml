  <introduction permid="jJa">

      We now know that the instantaneous rate of change of a function <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x = a</m>,
      or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> at <m>x = a</m>,
      is given by the value <m>f'(a)</m>.
      In all of our examples so far,
      we have identified a particular value of <m>a</m> as our point of interest:
      <m>a = 1</m>, <m>a = 3</m>, etc.
      But it is not hard to imagine that we will often be interested in the derivative value for more than just one <m>a</m>-value,
      and possibly for many of them.
      In this section,
      we explore how we can move from computing the derivative at a single point to computing a formula for <m>f'(a)</m> at any point <m>a</m>.
      Indeed, the process of <q>taking the derivative</q>
      generates a new function,
      denoted by <m>f'(x)</m>, derived from the original function <m>f(x)</m>.

  <subsection permid="Lgq">
    <title>How the Derivative is Itself a Function</title>
    <p permid="aZi">
      In your work in <xref ref="PA-1-4">Example</xref> with <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>,
      you may have found several patterns.
      One comes from observing that <m>f'(0) = 4</m>,
      <m>f'(1) = 2</m>, <m>f'(2) = 0</m>, and <m>f'(3) = -2</m>.
      That sequence of values leads us naturally to conjecture that
      <m>f'(4) = -4</m> and <m>f'(5) = -6</m>.
      We also observe that the particular value of <m>a</m> has very little effect on the process of computing the value of the derivative through the limit definition.
      To see this more clearly, we compute <m>f'(a)</m>
      where <m>a</m> is a variable <mdash /> that is, <m>a</m> represents a number to be named later.
      Following the now standard process of using the limit definition of the derivative,
      <md permid="cOv">
        <mrow>f'(a) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} </mrow>
		<mrow>= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4(a + h) - (a + h)^2 - (4a-a^2)}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4a + 4h - a^2 - 2ha - h^2 - 4a+a^2}{h} </mrow>
		<mrow>= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4h - 2ha - h^2}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h(4 - 2a - h)}{h} </mrow>
		<mrow>=  \lim_{h \to 0} (4 - 2a - h)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Hgr">
      Here we observe that neither <m>4</m> nor <m>2a</m> depend on the value of <m>h</m>,
      so as <m>h</m> tends to <m>0</m>, the quantity <m>(4 - 2a - h)</m> approaches <m>(4 - 2a)</m>.
      Thus <m>f'(a) = 4 - 2a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="nnA">
      This result is consistent with the specific values we found above:
      e.g., <m>f'(3) = 4 - 2(3) = -2</m>.
      And indeed, our work confirms that the value of <m>a</m> has almost no bearing on the process of computing the derivative.
      We note further that the letter being used is immaterial:
      whether we call it <m>a</m>,
      <m>x</m>, or anything else,
      the derivative at a given value is simply given by
      <q>4 minus 2 times the value.</q>
      We choose to use <m>x</m> for consistency with the original function given by <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      as well as for the purpose of graphing the derivative function.
      For the function <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>,
      it follows that <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="TuJ">
      Because the value of the derivative function is linked to the graph of the original function,
      it makes sense to look at both of these functions plotted on the same domain.
    </p>

      <caption>The graphs of <m>y=f(x)</m> (at left) with <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>, and of <m>y=f'(x)</m> (at right), where <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m>.  
      Slopes on the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> correspond to <m>y</m>-coordinates on the graph of <m>y=f'(x)</m>.</caption>

      The left half of <xref ref="F-1-4-ffprime">Figure</xref> above
      shows a plot of
      <m>y=f(x)</m>, where <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>, together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we considered in <xref ref="PA-1-4">Example</xref>.
      The right half of the figure shows a plot of
      <m>y=f'(x)</m>, where <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m>, with emphasis on the <m>y</m>-coordinates of the derivative graph at the same selection of points.
      Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graphs:
      the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way:
      <em>the slope of the tangent line</em>
      at a point on the left-hand graph is the same as the <em><m>y</m>-value</em>
      at the corresponding point on the right-hand graph.
      That is, at each respective value of <m>x</m>,
      the slope of the tangent line to the original function is the same as the output of the derivative function.
      Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different:
      in the left graph,
      the vertical units are simply the output units of <m>f</m>.
      On the righthand graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      the units on the vertical axis are units of <m>f</m> per unit of <m>x</m>.

      An excellent way to explore how the graph of <m>f(x)</m> generates the graph of <m>f'(x)</m> is through a java applet.

  The graphs of each given function with its derivative are shown below. 
  In graphing each derivative, it was easiest to first identify the points of 
  horizontal tangency on the original graph in order to plot the zeros of the derivative. 
  From there, we identified intervals where the original function was increasing (or 
  decreasing), and plotted positive (or negative) values for the derivative on those 
  same intervals. We ensured that the derivative values had larger magnitude at those 
  points where the original graph had the steepest slope. 
  In the case where the original graph had a corner or a cusp, we placed a jump discontinuity 
  in the derivative graph. Asymptotic behavior of the original function also was 
  reflected in the graph of the corresponding derivative function.

      <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m> and used the limit definition of the derivative to show that <m>f'(a) = 4 - 2a</m>,
      or equivalently that <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m>.
      We subsequently graphed the functions <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> in <xref ref="F-1-4-ffprime">Figure</xref>.
      Following <xref ref="act-1-4-1">Example</xref>,
      we now understand that we could have constructed a fairly accurate graph of <m>f'(x)</m> <em>without</em>
      knowing a formula for either <m>f</m> or <m>f'</m>.
      Even so,
      it is useful to know a formula for the derivative function whenever it is possible to find one.
    </p>

    <p permid="ksU">
      In the next example,
      we further explore the more algebraic approach to finding a derivative:
      given a formula for <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      the limit definition of the derivative will be used to develop a formula for <m>f'(x)</m>.
    </p>

      For each of the listed functions,
      determine a formula for the derivative function.
      For the first two,
      determine the formula for the derivative by thinking about the nature of the given function and its slope at various points;
      do not use the limit definition.
      For the latter four, use the limit definition.
      Pay careful attention to the function names and independent variables.
      It is important to be comfortable with using letters other than <m>f</m> and <m>x</m>.
      For example, given a function <m>p(z)</m>,
      we call its derivative <m>p'(z)</m>.

            produces a value for each <m>x</m> at which the derivative is defined,
            and this leads to a new function <m>y = f'(x)</m>.
            It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function <m>f</m> and produces a new,

            and writing <m>f'(x)</m>.

            we encountered some functions that had sharp corners on their graphs,

            At such points, the derivative fails to exist,
            and we say that <m>f</m> is not differentiable there.
            For now,
            it suffices to understand this as a consequence of the jump that must occur in the derivative function at a sharp corner on the graph of the original function.

              We observe that the point <m>(0.5, 2.75)</m> is the vertex of the quadratic function <m>g</m>,

              For <m>g(x) = x^2 - x + 3</m>,
              we found that <m>g'(x) = 2x - 1</m>.
              For <m>p(x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12</m>,
              we determined that <m>p'(x) = 10x - 4</m>.
              The constants <m>3</m> and <m>12</m> don't seem to affect the results at all,
              and that makes sense because those numbers only serve to shift the graphs of <m>g</m> and <m>p</m> vertically,
              which does nothing to change the slope.

              The coefficient <m>-4</m> on the linear term in <m>p(x)</m> appears to make the ``<m>-4</m>'' appear in <m>p'(x)= 10x - 4</m>.
              That, too, makes sense in light of the fact that if we considered only the linear function <m>L(x) = -4x</m>,
              the slope would everywhere be <m>-4</m>,
              in contrast to the coefficent <m>-1</m> found on the linear term in <m>g(x) = x^2 - x + 3</m>,
              which leads to the constant <m>-1</m> in <m>g'(x) = 2x - 1</m>.

              Finally, the leading coefficient <m>5</m> in
              <m>(x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12</m> leads to the coefficient of ``<m>10</m>'' in <m>p'(x) = 10x -4</m>.
              This makes sense because if we considered only <m>y = 5x^2</m>,
              the <m>5</m> would make the graph <m>5</m> times as steep as the graph of <m>y = x^2</m>,
              and thus it affects the derivative proportionately.
