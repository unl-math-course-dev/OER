  <introduction permid="xkC">
    <p permid="Ndu">
      Mathematicians are often interested in making general observations,
      say by describing patterns that hold in a large number of cases.
      Think about the Pythagorean Theorem:
      it doesn't tell us something about a single right triangle,
      but rather a fact about <em>every</em> right triangle.
      In the next part of our studies,
      we use calculus to make general observations about families of functions that depend on one or more <term>parameters</term>.
      <idx><h>parameters</h></idx>
      People who use applied mathematics,
      such as engineers and economists,
      often encounter the same types of functions where only small changes to certain constants occur.
      These constants are called parameters.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-3-2-SineFam" permid="lGe">
      <caption>The graph of <m>y=f(t)</m>, where <m>f(t) = a \sin(b(t-c)) + d</m>, based on parameters <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m>.</caption>
      <image width="65%" source="images/3_2_SineFam" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="tkD">
      You are already familiar with certain families of functions.
      For example,
      <m>f(t) = a \sin(b(t-c)) + d</m> is a stretched and shifted version of the sine function with amplitude <m>a</m>,
      period <m>\frac{2\pi}{b}</m>,
      phase shift <m>c</m>, and vertical shift <m>d</m>.
      We know that <m>a</m> affects the size of the oscillation,
      <m>b</m> the rapidity of oscillation,
      and <m>c</m> where the oscillation starts,
      as shown above in <xref ref="F-3-2-SineFam">Figure</xref>,
      while <m>d</m> affects the vertical positioning of the graph.
    </p>

    <p permid="ZrM">
      Here is another example: every function of the form
      <m>y = mx + b</m> is a line with slope <m>m</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,b)</m>.
      The value of <m>m</m> affects the line's steepness,
      and the value of <m>b</m> situates the line vertically on the coordinate axes.
      These two parameters describe all possible non-vertical lines.
    </p>

    <p permid="FyV">
      For other less familiar families of functions,
      we can use calculus to discover where key behavior occurs:
      e.g. where members of the family are increasing or decreasing,
      concave up or concave down,
      where relative extrema occur, and more,
      all in terms of the parameters involved.
      To get started,
      we revisit a common collection of functions to see how calculus confirms things we already know.

<solution>
<p>
<ol label="a">
  <li>
  <p>
  Since <m>f</m> is a second-degree polynomial in <m>x</m>, <m>f</m> is a quadratic function, and 
  the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is a parabola. The vertex of this parabola is at the point <m>(h,k)</m>, and 
  the sign of <m>a</m> determines whether the parabola opens upward (when <m>a\gt0</m>) or downward (when <m>a\lt0</m>).
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Because <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are constants, their derivatives are both <m>0</m> and 
  this simplifies the application of the sum rule in taking the derivative. 
  Furthermore, the product rule is unnecessary because <m>a</m> is a constant as well, 
  so we instead make use of the constant multiple rule. 
  Doing so while also applying the chain rule, we find that <me>f'(x)=2a(x-h)</me>. 
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Since <m>f'</m> is linear with slope <m>2a\neq0</m>, it is continuous (hence, defined 
  everywhere) and has exactly one root (where <m>f'(x)=0</m>). Thus the function 
  <m>f</m> will have exactly one critical number. Indeed, we see that <m>f'(x)=0</m> 
  only at the point <m>x=h</m>. 
  Therefore, the only critical number of <m>f</m> is <m>h</m>.
  We note that this agrees with our previous assertion that the vertex of <m>y=f(x)</m> 
  is at the point <m>(h,k)</m>.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  If <m>a\lt0</m>, then our algebra knowledge tells us that the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> 
  is a parabola that opens down, so we should find that <m>f</m> is increasing for <m>x\lt h</m> 
  and decreasing for <m>x\gt h</m>. 
  Testing this intuition, we note that 
  <ul>
  <li>
  When <m>x\lt h</m>, then <m>x-h\lt0</m> and hence <m>2a(x-h)\gt0</m> since <m>a</m> also is known to be negative.
  Therefore, on the interval <m>(-\infty,h)</m> we have <m>f'(x)\gt0</m> and <m>f</m> increasing.
  </li>
  <li>
  When <m>x\gt h</m>, then <m>x-h\gt0</m> and hence <m>2a(x-h)\lt0</m> since <m>a</m> is known to be negative.
  Therefore, on the interval <m>(h,\infty)</m> we have <m>f'(x)\lt0</m> and <m>f</m> decreasing.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Applying the first derivative test, we see that at the point <m>x=h</m>, the value of <m>f'(x)</m>
  switches from positive to negative, and thus <m>k</m>, the critical value corresponding to the critical number <m>h</m>, is a maximum of <m>f</m>.
  This agrees with our existing knowledge of parabolas, as we had established that this parabola opens downward.

    <title>Describing Families of Functions in Terms of Parameters</title>
    <p permid="RNn">
      Our goal is to describe the key characteristics of the overall behavior of each member of a family of functions in terms of its parameters.
      By finding the first and second derivatives and constructing sign charts
      (each of which may depend on one or more of the parameters),
      we can often make broad conclusions about how each member of the family will appear.

      <solution permid="drL">
        <p permid="SSG">
          We begin by computing <m>g'(x)</m>.
          By the product rule,
          <me permid="KiO">
            g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[ax]e^{-bx} +ax \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{-bx}\right]

        <p permid="yZP">
          To find the critical numbers of <m>g</m>,
          we note that <m>g'</m> is defined everywhere and proceed to solve the equation <m>g'(x) = 0</m>.
          By factoring <m>g'(x)</m>, we find
          <me permid="Wxg">
            0 = ae^{-bx}(1-bx)

        <p permid="fgY">
          Since we are given that <m>a \ne 0</m> and we know that
          <m>e^{-bx} \ne 0</m> for all values of <m>x</m>,
          the only way this equation can hold is when <m>1-bx = 0</m>.
          Solving for <m>x</m>, we find <m>x = \frac{1}{b}</m>,
          and this is therefore the only critical number of <m>g</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="rvq">
          Because the factor <m>ae^{-bx}</m> is always positive,
          the sign of <m>g'</m> depends on the linear factor <m>(1-bx)</m>,
          which is positive for
          <m>x \lt \frac{1}{b}</m> and negative for <m>x \gt \frac{1}{b}</m>.
          Hence we can not only conclude that <m>g</m> is always increasing for
          <m>x \lt \frac{1}{b}</m> and decreasing for <m>x \gt \frac{1}{b}</m>,
          but also that <m>g</m> has a global maximum at
          <m>\big(\frac{1}{b}, g\big(\frac{1}{b}\big)\big)</m> and no local minimum.
          The first derivative sign chart for <m>g</m> is shown below in <xref ref="F-3-2-signchartg">Figure</xref>.

        <p permid="XCz">
          We turn next to analyzing the concavity of <m>g</m>.
          With <m>g'(x) = ae^{-bx}-abxe^{-bx}</m>,

        <p permid="DJI">
          Combining like terms and factoring, we now have

        <p permid="jQR">
          We observe that <m>abe^{-bx}</m> is always positive,
          and thus the sign of <m>g''</m> depends on the sign of <m>(bx-2)</m>,
          which is zero when <m>x = \frac{2}{b}</m>.
          Since <m>b</m> is positive,
          the value of <m>(bx-2)</m> is negative for
          <m>x \lt \frac{2}{b}</m> and positive for <m>x \gt \frac{2}{b}</m>.
          The sign chart for <m>g''</m> is shown below in <xref ref="F-3-2-signchartg2">Figure</xref>.
          Thus, <m>g</m> is concave down for all

        </figure>

        <p permid="PYa">
          Finally, we analyze the long-term behavior of <m>g</m> by considering two limits.
          First, we note that
          <me permid="OSH">
            \lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} axe^{-bx} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{ax}{e^{bx}}

        </p>

        <p permid="wfj">
          This limit has indeterminate form <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>, so 
          with our current tools, we can not evaluate the limit algebraically. We can, however, 
          reason that <m>ax</m> is linear while <m>e^{bx}</m> is exponential, and conclude that 
          because exponential growth is so much more rapid than linear growth, we 
          expect the limiting value to be zero. A more rigorous answer will 
          be possible following <xref ref="sec-2-8-LHR">Section</xref>, but for now we can also
          use graphical evidence<fn>
          A good tool to use here is <url href="http://www.desmos.com/calculator/vvscoo435h">desmos.com</url>.
          </fn>
          to support the claim that <m>\lim_{x\to\infty}g(x)=0</m>. We do so by examining 
          the graphs of several different functions in this family, noting that each has a 
          horizontal asymptote of <m>y=0</m> as <m>x\to\infty</m>.
          <!--we apply L'Hopital's Rule and find that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = 0</m>.-->
          In the other direction,
          <me permid="uZQ">
            \lim_{x \to -\infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} axe^{-bx} = -\infty
          </me>,
          because <m>ax \to -\infty</m> and
          <m>e^{-bx} \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to -\infty</m>.
          Hence, as we move left on its graph,
          <m>g</m> decreases without bound,
          while as we move to the right, <m>g(x) \to 0</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="cms">
          All of this information now helps us produce the graph of a typical member of this family of functions without using a graphing utility
          (and without choosing particular values for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>),
          as shown in <xref ref="F-3-2-SurgeFam">Figure</xref> below.

          the global maximum occurs at the point <m>\big(\frac{1}{b}, g\big(\frac{1}{b}\big)\big) = \big(\frac{1}{b}, \frac{a}{b}e^{-1}\big)</m>,
          so the larger the value of <m>a</m>,
          the greater the value of the global maximum.

      The work we've completed in <xref ref="Ex-3-2-1">Example</xref>
      can often be replicated for other families of functions that depend on parameters.
      Normally we are most interested in determining all critical numbers,
      a first derivative sign chart,
      a second derivative sign chart,
      and the limit of the function as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
      Throughout,
      we prefer to work with the parameters as arbitrary constants.
      In addition,
      we can experiment with some particular values of the parameters present to reduce the algebraic complexity of our work.
      What follows are several key examples where we see that the values of the parameters substantially affect the behavior of individual functions within a given family.

            We first note that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m>,
            so to find critical numbers we set
            <m>p'(x) = 0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
            This leads to the equation <m>3x^2 - a = 0</m>,

            if <m>a \lt  0</m>, then the equation has no solution.
            Hence,
            <m>p</m> has two critical numbers <m>\left(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\right)</m> whenever <m>a \gt 0</m> and no critical numbers when <m>a \lt  0</m>.

            and thus <m>p</m> is always increasing and has no relative extreme values.
            (There are no critical numbers to place on the first derivative sign chart,
            and <m>p'</m> is always positive.)
            For the case when <m>a\gt 0</m>,
            we observe that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> is a concave up parabola with zeros at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>.
            It follows that for <m>x \lt -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m>
            (so <m>p</m> is increasing);

              This linear function of <m>x</m> has negative slope,
              and thus is positive for <m>x \lt m</m> and negative for <m>x \gt m</m>,
              and thus <m>E'(x)</m> is positive for <m>x \lt m</m> and negative for <m>x \gt m</m>.
              Therefore, <m>E</m> is increasing for <m>x \lt m</m> and decreasing for <m>x \gt m</m>,
              with a local maximum at <m>x = m</m>.

              From the given formula for <m>E''(x)</m> and our knowledge that <m>e</m> to any power is positive,
              the only way <m>E''(x) = 0</m> is for
              <me permid="GtT">
                \left(\frac{(x-m)^2 - s^2}{s^4} \right) = 0
              </me>,
              which implies that <m>(x-m)^2 = s^2</m>,
              and therefore <m>x-m = \pm s</m>, or <m>x = m \pm s</m>.
              These are the two values for which <m>E''(x) = 0</m>.

              As <m>x \to \pm \infty</m>,
              we know that the quadratic function
              <m>-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}</m> must decrease without bound because the quadratic function opens down.
              Thus, the power to which we are raising <m>e</m> in the formula for <m>E(x)</m> is decreasing without bound,
              which means that <m>E(x)</m> must approach <m>0</m> since raising <m>e</m> to more and more negative numbers drives the result to <m>0</m>.
              Thus, <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} E(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} E(x) = 0</m>.

              We've shown that <m>E</m> has a single critical number at <m>x = m</m> and two potential points of inflection at <m>x = m \pm s</m>,
              as well as that <m>E(x) \to 0</m> as <m>x \to \pm \infty</m>.
              All of these properties are reflected in the following figure.
