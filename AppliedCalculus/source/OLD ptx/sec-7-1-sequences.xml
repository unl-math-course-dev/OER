        We encounter sequences every day.
        Your monthly utility payments,
        the annual interest you earn on investments,
        the amount you spend on groceries each week;
        all are examples of sequences.
        Other sequences with which you may be familiar include the Fibonacci sequence
        <idx><h>Fibonacci sequence</h></idx>
        <m> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \ldots </m>,

      Sequences of integers are of such interest to mathematicians and others that they have a journal<fn>
        <pubtitle>The Journal of Integer Sequences</pubtitle> at <url href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/" />
      </fn> devoted to them and an online encyclopedia<fn>
        The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences at <url href="http://oeis.org/" />
      </fn> that catalogs a huge number of integer sequences and their connections.
      Sequences are also used in digital recordings and images.

      Our studies in calculus have dealt with continuous functions.
      Sequences model <em>discrete</em>
      instead of continuous information.
      We will study ways to represent and work with discrete information in this chapter as we investigate
      <em>sequences</em> and <em>series</em>,
      and ultimately see key connections between the discrete and continuous.

      <statement>

          Suppose you receive <m>\$5,\!000</m> through an inheritance.
          You decide to invest this money into a fund that pays <m>8\%</m> annually,
          compounded monthly.
          That means that each month your investment earns <m>\frac{0.08}{12} \cdot P</m> additional dollars,
          where <m>P</m> is your principal balance at the start of the month.
          So in the first month your investment earns
          <me permid="zjg">
            5000 \left(\frac{0.08}{12}\right)

          or <m>\$ 33.33</m>.
          If you reinvest this money,
          you will then have <m>\$ 5033.33</m> in your account at the end of the first month.
          From this point on,
          assume that you reinvest all of the interest you earn.

              <p>You may notice some small difference in your results from the formula, due to the way rounding happens in each method. To compute the balance in the account after 5 years, we can use the formula with <m>n=60</m> months, to get
                <me>
                  P_{60}=5000\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)^{60} = \$7449.23.

            <li>
              <p>
                The goal is to find the time it takes for the account to reach a balance of <m>\$ 10,\!000</m>. To do this, we can use the formula, and filling in everything we know, we have
                <me>
                  10000=5000\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)^n.
                </me>
                We can then solve for the number of months as follows:
                <md>
                  <mrow> 10000 \amp = 5000\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)^n</mrow>
                  <mrow> 2 \amp = \left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)^n</mrow>
                  <mrow> \ln (2) \amp = n \ln \left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)</mrow>
                  <mrow> \frac{\ln (2)}{\ln\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)} \amp = n </mrow>
                </md>.
                This gives us that the number of months until the account reaches <m>\$ 10,\!000</m> is <m>\frac{\ln (2)}{\ln\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)} \approx 104.3 </m>. This amounts to about <m>8.7</m> years.

      As <xref ref="PA-8-1">Example</xref> illustrates,
      many discrete phenomena can be represented as lists of numbers
      (like the amount of money in an account over a period of months).
      We call any such list a <term>sequence</term>.
      A sequence is nothing more than list of terms in some order.
      We often list the entries of the sequence with subscripts,
      <me permid="ROA">
        s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n, \ldots
      </me>,
      where the subscript denotes the position of the entry in the sequence.

    <p permid="PZn">
    <assemblage><idx><h>sequence</h></idx>
      <title> Sequence </title>
      <p>
        A <term>sequence</term> is a list of terms
        <m>s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots</m> in a specified order.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    </p>
    
    <p permid="gXy">
      We can think of a sequence as a function <m>f</m> whose domain is the set of positive integers where 
      <m>f(n) = s_n</m> for each positive integer <m>n</m>.
      This alternative view will be be useful in many situations.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="NeH">
      We often denote the sequence
      <m permid="xVJ">
        s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots
      </m>
      by <m>\{s_n\}</m>.
      The value <m>s_n</m> (alternatively <m>s(n)</m>) is called the <m>n</m>th <term>term</term>
      <idx><h>sequence</h><h>term</h></idx>
      in the sequence.
      If the terms are all 0 after some fixed value of <m>n</m>,
      we say the sequence is finite.
      Otherwise the sequence is infinite.</p>
    
    <p> We often define sequences using formulas, which can be explicit or recursive. 
      Explicit formulas write the term <m>s_n</m> in terms of <m>n</m>, while recursive formulas
      write <m>s_n</m> in terms of the earlier entries in the sequence.
      Often, explicit formulas are easier to work with because they can be used to directly find any term in the sequence.
      
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p> Given the explicit sequence formula <m>s_n=\frac{3n-1}{n+2}</m>, find <m>s_1, s_2, s_{10}</m>, and <m>s_{1000}</m>. </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p> Since the formula is explicit, we simply substitute in the appropriate value for <m>n</m>.
          
          <me> s_1= \frac{3(1)-1}{1+2}=\frac{2}{3}</me>,
          <me> s_2=\frac{3(2)-1}{2+2}=\frac{5}{4}</me>,
          <me> s_{10}=\frac{3(10)-1}{10+2}=\frac{29}{12}</me>,
          <me> s_{1000}=\frac{3(1000)-1}{1000+2}=\frac{2999}{1002}</me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    
    <p> Recursively defined sequences, on the other hand, use a formula that relies on previous terms in the sequence and requires
      some of the first few terms to be set to get started.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>For each of the following recursively defined sequences, give the first six terms.

      The idea of sequence having a limit as

          We return to the example begun in <xref ref="PA-8-1">Preview Activity</xref>

      <title> Sampling Continuous Data</title>
      <statement>
        <p permid="eRM">
          Continuous data is the basis for analog information,
          like music stored on old cassette tapes or vinyl records.
          A digital signal like on a CD or MP3 file is obtained by sampling an analog signal at some regular time interval and storing that information.
          For example,
          the sampling rate of a compact disk is 44,100 samples per second.
          So a digital recording is only an approximation of the actual analog information.
          Digital information can be manipulated in many useful ways that allow for,
          among other things,
          noisy signals to be cleaned up and large collections of information to be compressed and stored in much smaller space.
          While we won't investigate these techniques in this chapter,
          this exercise is intended to give an idea of the importance of discrete (digital) techniques.

                Ineffective sampling can lead to several problems in reproducing the original signal.
                As an example,
                partition the interval <m>[0,10]</m> into 8 equal length subintervals and create a list of points
                (the <em>sample</em>)
                using the endpoints of each subinterval.

                The sampling rate is the number of samples of a signal taken per second.
                As the part (a) illustrates,
                sampling at too small a rate can cause serious problems with reproducing the original signal
                (this problem of inefficient sampling leading to an inaccurate approximation is called <em>aliasing</em>).
                There is an elegant theorem called the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem that says that human perception is limited,
                which allows that replacement of a continuous signal with a digital one without any perceived loss of information.
                This theorem also provides the <em>lowest</em>
                rate at which a signal can be sampled
                (called the Nyquist rate)
                without such a loss of information.
                The theorem states that we should sample at double the maximum desired frequency so that every cycle of the original signal will be sampled at at least two points.
                Recall that the frequency of a sinusoidal function is the reciprocal of the period.
                Identify the frequency of the function <m>f</m> and determine the number of partitions of the interval <m>[0,10]</m> that give us the Nyquist rate.

                its frequency is <m>\frac{2}{\pi} \approx 0.6366</m>,
