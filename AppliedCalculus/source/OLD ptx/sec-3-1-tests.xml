          <m>f(c) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.

      The function <m>g</m> has a global maximum of <m>g(c)</m>,
      but <m>g</m> does not appear to have a global minimum,
      as the graph of <m>g</m> seems to decrease without bound.
      Note that the point <m>(c,g(c))</m> marks a fundamental change in the behavior of <m>g</m>

      We have already identified the global maximum of <m>g</m> as <m>g(c)</m>;

<solution>
  <p>
  <ol label="a.">
    <li>
    <p>
    The graph shows that <m>h(x)\le-1=h(-2)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>-2</m> and 
    <m>h(x)\le2=h(1)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>1</m>. We notice that these are points where <m>h</m>
    switches from increasing to decreasing. Since there are no other points on the graph where the 
    <m>y</m>-coordinate is larger than everything nearby, it follows that the only local 
    maxima of <m>h</m> on this domain occur at <m>c=-2</m> and <m>c=1</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    The graph shows that <m>h(x)\ge-2=h(0)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>0</m>, a point where 
    <m>h</m> switches from decreasing to increasing. Since this is the only point shown where this occurs, 
    we say that the only local minimum of <m>h</m> on this domain occurs at <m>c=0</m>.
    <!--However, because we are looking at a restricted domain, 
    on the left we see that <m>h</m> starts out by going up, so <m>h(x)\ge-3=h(-3)</m> for every <m>x</m> near to 
    (and greater than) <m>-3</m>. Similarly, on the right we see that <m>h</m> finishes by going down, 
    so <m>h(x)\ge-1.25=h(3)</m> for all <m>x</m> near to (and less than) <m>3</m>. At the very least, then, 
    we can say that the local minima of <m>h</m> <em>on the domain <m>[-3,3]</m></em> are 
    <m>c=-3</m>, <m>c=0</m>, and <m>c=3</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Again, we emphasize that the endpoints of the domain are special. If the graph extended to either side, 
    we could not say with certainty whether the points <m>(-3,h(-3))</m> and <m>(3,h(3))</m> are local minima or not.
    They might be, if the graph changed direction again, but they would not be if the graph followed the existing trend. -->
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    The highest point shown on the graph is the point <m>(1,2)</m>. Since <m>h</m> is 
    continuous on <m>[-3,3]</m>, we don't have to worry about any points on the interval being higher and not 
    showing up on the displayed grid. Hence we say the global maximum of <m>h</m> on the interval 
    <m>[-3,3]</m> is <m>2</m> and occurs at <m>x=1</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    The lowest point shown on the graph is the point <m>(-3,-3)</m>. Again, since <m>h</m> is 
    continuous on <m>[-3,3]</m>, we don't have to worry about any points on the interval being lower 
    and not showing up in the window that is displayed. Thus we say the global minimum of <m>h</m> on
    the interval <m>[-3,3]</m> is <m>-3</m> and occurs at <m>x=-3</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    It is worth noting that this was not a point that we found as a local minimum. The difference 
    is that here we are restricting our focus to the interval that is shown, effectively 
    cutting off the graph at its endpoints. Earlier, when we were looking for relative 
    minima, we made the assumption that the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> continues outside of the depicted 
    interval by following the trends displayed and continuing downward on both sides.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    When looking for points <m>(c,h(c))</m> at which <m>h'(c)=0</m>, we are looking for 
    points of horizontal tangency. The graph flattens out at <m>(-2.5,-2)</m> and <m>(1,2)</m>, 
    but nowhere else<fn>
    Note that at <m>(1.5,1)</m> it looks as though the graph is flat to the right of this point. However, 
    the derivative is undefined here because of the cusp, so this is not a point of horizontal tangency
    </fn>. 
    Thus <m>h'(c)=0</m> exactly when <m>c=-2.5</m> and <m>c=1</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Recall that <m>h'(c)</m> only exists when all of the following are true:
    <ul>
    <li><p><m>h(c)</m> is defined,</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\lim_{x\to c}h(x)</m> exists,</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\lim_{x\to c}h(x)=h(c)</m>, and </p></li>
    <li><p><m>\lim_{a\to0}\frac{h(c+a)-h(c)}a</m> exists.</p></li>
    </ul>
    Assuming <m>h</m> is continuous at <m>c</m> (i.e. the first three points hold), 
    the main consequence of the final point is that a corner or a cusp at <m>(c,h(c))</m> 
    makes <m>h</m> nondifferentiable at <m>c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    With all this in mind, we can say that <m>h'(c)</m> does not exist at <m>c=-2</m>, <m>c=0</m>, or <m>c=1.5</m>
    because <m>h</m> has a cusp at these points. 
    <!-- Moreover, <m>h'(-3)</m> does not exist because 
    <m>\lim_{a\to0^-}\frac{h(-3+a)-h(-3)}a</m> is undefined, and <m>h'(3)</m> does not 
    exist because <m>\lim_{a\to0^+}\frac{h(3+a)-h(3)}a</m> is undefined.-->
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    This is true. Every relative extremum of <m>h</m> occurs at a point where <m>h'(c)</m>
    is either zero or does not exist. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    This is false. Some points at which <m>h'(c)</m> is zero or undefined are not relative extrema. 
    In particular, <m>h'(-2.5)</m> is zero, but the graph is non-decreasing near <m>(-2.5,-2)</m>. 
    Similarly, <m>h'(1.5)</m> is undefined, but the graph is non-increasing near <m>(1.5,1)</m>.
    Neither of these points is a local maximum or minimum.

	Suppose a function <m>f</m> is continuous on an open interval <m>(a,b)</m>.

        <p permid="WiL">
          Since we already have <m>f'(x)</m> written in factored form,
          it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
          Because <m>f'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>,
          we need only determine where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
          From the equation
          <me permid="Afi">
            e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2 = 0
          </me>
          and the zero product property<fn>
          The zero product property says that if <m>ab=0</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are 
          expressions representing real numbers (e.g. <m>a=(3-x)</m>, where <m>x</m> is a real number), 
          then it must be the case that <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m> (or both). 
          </fn>,
          it follows that <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = -1</m> are critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
          (There is no value of <m>x</m> that makes <m>e^{-2x} = 0</m>.)
        </p>

        <p permid="CpU">
          Next, to apply the first derivative test,
          we'd like to know the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> at inputs near the critical numbers.
          Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which <m>f'</m> can change sign,
          it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers:
          for instance,
          the sign of <m>f'</m> must be the same for every <m>x \lt -1</m>.
          What this means is that we can choose (carefully) where to evaluate the derivative 
          in order to ascertain its sign on a given interval. Since <m>f'(-1.000001)</m> and 
          <m>f'(-2)</m> must have the same sign, we may as well evaluate <m>f'(x)</m> at <m>-2</m>
          to figure out the sign of <m>f'</m> for <m>x\lt -1</m>. 
          We create a first derivative sign chart (displayed below, with explanation following) 
          to summarize the sign of <m>f'</m> on the relevant intervals,
          along with the corresponding behavior of <m>f</m>.

        <p permid="ixd">
          To produce the first derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart">Figure</xref>, 
          we start by marking the critical numbers <m>-1</m> and <m>3</m> on the number line.
          We then identify the sign of each factor of <m>f'(x)</m> at one selected point in each interval.
          The intervals in this example are <m>x\lt-1</m>, <m>-1\lt x\lt3</m>, and <m>x\gt3</m>; we will choose 
          <m>x=-2</m>, <m>x=0</m>, and <m>x=5</m> for our selected points. The process with <m>x=-2</m> is laid out below:
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>x \lt -1</m>,
          we use the value <m>x=-2</m> to determine the sign of <m>e^{-2x}</m>,
          <m>(3-x)</m>, and <m>(x+1)^2</m>.
          We note that <m>e^{-2x}</m> is positive regardless of the value of <m>x</m>, 
          <m>(x+1)^2</m> is positive whenever it is nonzero <mdash /> which is everywhere 
          within the intervals of interest since we intentionally plucked out the zeros <mdash />
          and that <m>(3-x)</m> is also positive at <m>x = -2</m>.
          Hence each of the three terms in <m>f'</m> is positive,
          and we indicate this by writing <q><m>+++</m></q> above the interval <m>x\lt-1</m>.
          Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for <m>f'</m>,
          so we denote the sign of <m>f'</m> by a <q><m>+</m></q> above the appropriate interval in the chart. 
          Finally, since <m>f'</m> is positive on that interval,
          we know that <m>f</m> is increasing,
          so we write <q>INC</q>
          to represent the behavior of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a similar fashion,
          we find that <m>f'</m> is positive (because <m>3-(0)\gt0</m> and the other terms are also still positive) and <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>-1 \lt x \lt 3</m>,
          and that <m>f'</m> is negative (because <m>3-(5)\lt0</m> but the other terms are still positive) and <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \gt 3</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="OEm">
          Now we look for critical numbers at which <m>f'</m> changes sign.
          In this example, <m>f'</m> changes sign only at <m>x = 3</m>,
          from positive to negative,
          so <m>f</m> has a relative maximum at <m>x = 3</m>.
          Although <m>f</m> has a critical number at <m>x = -1</m>,
          since <m>f</m> is increasing both before and after <m>x = -1</m>,
          <m>f</m> has neither a minimum nor a maximum at <m>x = -1</m>.

      Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us several important things about the behavior of the function itself.
      For instance, if <m>f''</m> is positive on an interval,
      then we know that on that interval <m>f'</m> is increasing and,
      consequently, that <m>f</m> is concave up.
      Hence throughout that interval the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> lies below the curve at every point.
      At a point where <m>f'(p) = 0</m>,

          Since we know <m>f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2</m>,
          we can find the critical numbers of <m>f</m> by solving <m>3x^4 - 9x^2 = 0</m>.
          Factoring, we observe that

        <p permid="ngW">
          Next, we move on to investigate concavity.
          Differentiating <m>f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2</m>,
          we see that <m>f''(x) = 12x^3 - 18x</m>.
          Since we are interested in knowing the intervals on which <m>f''</m> is positive and negative,
          we first find where <m>f''(x) = 0</m>.
          Observe that

          This equation has solutions <m>x = 0, \pm\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}</m>.
          Building a sign chart for <m>f''</m> in the exact same way we do for <m>f'</m>,

          similarly, the point <m>E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})</m> is a local minimum.
          Note, too, that <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>A</m> and concave up at <m>E</m>,
          which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test.
          At points <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>, concavity changes,
          as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart3">Figure</xref>.
          Finally, at point <m>C</m>,
          <m>f</m> has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line,
          but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there,
          since <m>f</m> is decreasing both before and after <m>C</m>.
          It is also the case that concavity changes at <m>C</m>.

          we do not know any specific information about the <m>y</m>-coordinates of points on the curve.

          while we know that <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -\sqrt{3}</m>,
          we don't know the value of that maximum because we do not know <m>f(-\sqrt{3})</m>.

              <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,
              <m>f''(x)</m> is negative, while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else.
              This shows that <m>f</m> is concave down for
              <m>-0.35 \lt x \lt 1</m> while being concave up everywhere else.
              We thus see that <m>f</m> has points of inflection at both <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and <m>x = 1</m>.

              Now that we know where <m>f</m> is increasing and decreasing as well as where <m>f</m> is concave up and concave down,
              along with the fact that <m>f(0) = -0.5</m>,
              we can sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.
              Note that we also know <m>f</m> has a horizontal tangent line at <m>x = 1</m> while being increasing on either side of <m>x = 1</m>,
              and earlier we established that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m>.
              After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through <m>(0,-0.5)</m>,
              we arrive at the graph shown at left below.
