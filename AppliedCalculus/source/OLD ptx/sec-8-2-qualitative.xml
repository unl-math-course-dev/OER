  <introduction permid="TDA">
    <p permid="GjP">
      In earlier work, we have used the tangent line to the graph of a
      function <m>f</m> at a point <m>a</m> to approximate the values of <m>f</m> near <m>a</m>.
      The usefulness of this approximation is that we need to know very
      little about the function;
      armed with only the value <m>f(a)</m> and the
      derivative <m>f'(a)</m>,
      we may find the equation of the tangent line and
      the approximation
      <me permid="AuD">
        f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="mqY">
      Remember that a first-order differential equation gives us information about the derivative of an unknown function.
      Since the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the tangent line at this point,
      a differential equation gives us crucial information about the tangent lines to the graph of a solution.
      We will use this information about the tangent lines to create a <em>slope field</em>
      for the differential equation,
      which enables us to sketch solutions to initial value problems.
      Our aim will be to understand the solutions qualitatively.
      That is, we would like to understand the basic nature of solutions,
      such as their long-range behavior,
      without precisely determining the value of a solution at a particular point.

      shows that we can sketch the solution to an initial value problem if we know an appropriate collection of tangent lines.
      We can use the differential equation to find the slope of the tangent line at any point of interest,

    <title> Slope Field </title>
    <p> A <term> slope field </term> for a first-order differential equation <m> \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y,t) </m> is a plot of small tangent lines to the graph of the solution at a selection of points <m> (t,y) </m> on a rectangular grid.

    <p permid="yFq">
      Let's continue looking at the differential equation <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = t-2</m>.
      If <m>t=0</m>, this equation says that <m>dy/dt = 0-2=-2</m>.
      Note that this value holds regardless of the value of <m>y</m>.
      We will therefore sketch tangent lines for several values of <m>y</m> and <m>t=0</m> with a slope of <m>-2</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="F-7-2-field-0">Figure</xref>.

      Let's continue in the same way:

      the differential equation tells us that <m>dy/dt = 1-2=-1</m>,
      and this holds regardless of the value of <m>y</m>.
      We now sketch tangent lines for several values of <m>y</m> and <m>t=1</m> with a slope of <m>-1</m> in

      We can begin with the initial value
      <m>y(0) = 1</m> and start sketching the solution by following the tangent line.
      Whenever the solution passes through a point at which a tangent line is drawn,
      that line is tangent to the solution.

      As our work in <xref ref="act-7-2-1">Example</xref> demonstrates,
      first-order autonomous equations may have solutions that are constant.
      These are simple to detect by inspecting the differential equation <m>dy/dt = f(y)</m>:
      constant solutions necessarily have a zero derivative,
      so <m>dy/dt = 0 = f(y)</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="HZc">
      For example, in <xref ref="act-7-2-1">Example</xref>,
      we considered the equation <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)=-\frac12(y-4)</m>.
      Constant solutions are found by setting <m>f(y) = -\frac12(y-4) = 0</m>,
      which we immediately see implies that <m>y = 4</m>.

              On their own,

              By taking both the rates at which mice are added and removed from the population into account,

              To find the equilibrium solutions,
              we first set <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = 0</m>.
              Doing so, we find that
              <m>20y = \frac{y}{2+y}</m>,
              so <m>40y + 20y^2 = y</m>, or <m>39y + 20y^2 = 0</m>.
              Factoring, we see
              <m>y(39y + 20) = 0</m> and therefore <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y = -\frac{20}{39}</m>.
              Since a negative equilibrium solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem,
              the only equilibrium solution to study is <m>y = 0</m>.
              If we plot <m>dy/dt</m> versus <m>y</m> for <m>y \gt 0</m>,
              we see that <m>dy/dt</m> is always positive,
              and thus the population will grow away from <m>y = 0</m>,
              making this equilibrium unstable.
              And this makes sense:  the population of mice will grow without bound,
              because one cat is insufficient to keep up with a mice population growing at a rate of <m>20</m> times its size per year.

              Similar work as in (d) shows that the equilibrium solutions are <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y = 1</m>,
              and if we plot <m>dy/dt</m> versus <m>y</m>,
              we see that for <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m>,

              In other words,
              we need enough cats that there's a positive equilibrium solution.

              we require that <m>40-C \lt 0</m>,
              and therefore the farmer must bring at least <m>41</m> cats to the farm.
              Even in that circumstance,
              whether the cats can keep the number of mice from growing without bound will depend on the initial number of mice present.
