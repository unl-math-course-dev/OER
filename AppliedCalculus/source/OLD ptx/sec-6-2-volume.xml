  <subsection>
    <title> Volume as the Integral of Cross-Sectional Area </title>
    
    
    <p>
      In the previous section, we saw that the way we find area of a 2D region is to slice it into thin rectangles, and then integrate the height of the rectangles.
      The same principle lets us find the volume of a 3D shape: slice it into thin <q> cross-sections </q>, and then integrate the area of the cross-sections.
      So while the formula for area is
      
      <me>
        \text{Area}= \int_a^b f(x)\, dx
      </me>
      
      where <m> f(x) </m> is the height of a rectangle at <m> x </m>, <m> dx </m> is the width of the rectangle, and <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> are the endpoints of the interval , the formula for volume is
      
      <me>
        \text{Volume}= \int_a^b A(x)\, dx
      </me>
      
      where <m> A(x) </m> is the area of the cross-section at <m> x </m>, <m> dx </m> is the width, and <m> a </m> and <m> b </m> are the endpoints of the interval. 
      In <xref ref="PA-6-2">Example</xref>, we saw that the cross-sections were circles, so we used the circle area formula to get <m>A(x)=\pi r^2=\pi (-\frac 35 x +3)^2</m>,
      and integrated from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=5</m> since those corresponded to the  top and bottom of the cone.
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As we saw in the previous section, for 2D shapes it is sometimes more convenient to integrate with respect to <m>y</m> instead of <m>x</m>.
      The same is true for 3D shapes. 
      In fact, one may want to integrate with respect to <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m>, and you should try to choose the variable of integration so that all of your cross-sections are the same shape.
      For instance, in <xref ref="PA-6-2">Example</xref>, we integrated with respect to <m>x</m> so that the cross-sections were all circles. 
      If we had taken slices in another direction, the area of a cross-section would have been much more complicated and the integral would have been much harder!
      
      
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a pyramid with a 1-by-1 square base along the <m>xy</m>-plane with corners at
          <m> (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,0)</m>, and tapering up to a point at <m>(0,0,2)</m>. 
        </p>
        
        <image width="60%" source="images/6_2_Ex2_Figure.png" /> 
        
        <p>Notice that every <m>z</m>-cross-section (i.e. slice parallel to the <m>xy</m>-plane) is a square, so we will want to integrate with respect to <m>z</m>.
          
          <ol label="a.">
            
            <li>
              <p>
                Slicing the pyramid at a <m>z</m>-value (height) between 0 and 2 gives a square shape. 
                Find the linear function <m>f(z)</m> that gives the side-length of this square.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Since the <m>z</m>-cross-sections are squares, we will want to integrate with respect to <m>z</m>. Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is 
                <me>
                  \text{Volume} = \int_a^b A(z) dz
                </me>
                The endpoints <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> represent the <m>z</m>-values (heights) where the pyramid starts and stops. What are <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>?

                Combine your answers to the previous parts to set up a definite integral that represents the volume of the pyramid,

                Slicing at <m> z=0 </m> gives the base of the pyramid, which is a square of side length 1, so <m> f(0)=1</m>.

      It is possible to revolve a region around any horizontal or vertical line.
      Doing so adjusts the radii of the cylinders or washers involved by a constant value.
      A careful, well-labeled plot of the solid of revolution will usually reveal how the different axis of revolution affects the definite integral.

      A definite integral may be used to represent the volume of a solid. The idea is to slice the solid into thin shapes whose volume is easy to calculate. The volume of each slice is found by taking the area of the cross-section and multiplying it by the width. Summing up the volumes of the slices and taking the limit as the width <m> \rightarrow 0 </m> results in an integral representing the volume.

                We slice horizontally and thus the resulting cross-sections are cylinders with thickness <m>\triangle y</m>.
                The radius of the disks changes as <m>y</m> passes through <m>f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{8} = 1.125</m>,
                so we need two different integrals to find the total volume.
                Since we are slicing horizontally,
                we will integrate with respect to <m>y</m>,
                so we  need to solve both of our equations for <m>x</m> as functions of <m>y</m>.
                Observe that <m>y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2 </m> implies <m>2(y-1) = (x-2)^2</m>,
                so <m>x-2 = \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m> and thus <m>x = 2 \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m>,
                and similarly <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> implies <m>x = \pm \sqrt{2y}</m>.
                The portion of the curve defined by
                <m>y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2</m> that determines one of the boundaries is the left hand portion of the parabola,
                so <m>x = 2 - \sqrt{2(y-1)}</m>,
                while the portion of the curve
                <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> that determines the other boundary is the right hand portion of the parabola,
                so <m>x = \sqrt{2y}</m>.
                These two curves define the radius of the disk
                (one for <m>y \lt 1.125</m>, the other for <m>y \gt 1.125</m>)
                and the lowest point on the region is <m>(0,0)</m> while the highest is <m>(0,3)</m>.
