          How are both of the above concepts and their corresponding use of definite integrals similar to problems we have encountered in the past involving formulas such as
          <q>distance equals rate times time</q>
          and <q>mass equals density times volume</q>?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
  
  <introduction permid="NGX">
    <figure xml:id="F-6-4-Intro" permid="wnn">
      <caption>Three settings where we compute the accumulation of a varying quantity:  the area under <m>y = f(x)</m>, the distance traveled by an object with velocity <m>y = v(t)</m>, and the mass of a bar with density function <m>y=\rho(x)</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/6_4_Intro" />
    </figure>
    
    <p permid="fpc">
      We have seen several different circumstances where the definite integral enables us to measure the accumulation of a quantity that varies,
      provided the quantity is approximately constant over small intervals.
      For instance, to find
      the area bounded by a nonnegative curve
      <m>y = f(x)</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      we take a representative slice of width
      <m>\Delta x</m> that has area <m>A_{\text{slice} } = f(x) \Delta x</m>.
      As we let the width of the representative slice tend to zero,
      we find that the exact area of the region is
      <me permid="ejJ">
        A = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
      </me>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="Lwl">
      In a similar way,
      if we know the velocity <m>v(t)</m> of a moving object
      and we wish to know the distance the object travels on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> where <m>v(t)</m> is nonnegative,
      we can use a definite integral to generalize the fact that
      <m>d = r \cdot t</m> when the rate, <m>r</m>, is constant.
      On a short time interval <m>\Delta t</m>,
      <m>v(t)</m> is roughly constant,
      so for a small slice of time,
      <m>d_{\text{slice} } = v(t) \Delta t</m>.
      As the width of the time interval <m>\Delta t</m> tends to zero,
      the exact distance traveled is given by the definite integral
      <me permid="KqS">
        d = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt
      </me>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="rDu">
      Finally, if we want to determine the mass of an object of non-constant density,
      because <m>M = D \cdot V</m>
      (mass equals density times volume,
      provided that density is constant),
      we can consider a small slice of an object on which the density is approximately constant,
      and a definite integral may be used to determine the exact mass of the object.
      For instance,
      if we have a thin rod whose cross sections have constant density,
      but whose density is distributed along the <m>x</m> axis according to the function <m>y = \rho(x)</m>,
      it follows that for a small slice of the rod that is <m>\Delta x</m> thick,
      <m>M_{\text{slice} } = \rho(x) \Delta x</m>.
      In the limit as <m>\Delta x \to 0</m>,
      we then find that the total mass is given by
      <me permid="qyb">
        M = \int_a^b \rho(x) \, dx
      </me>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="XKD">
      All three of these situations are similar in that we have a basic rule (<m>A = l \cdot w</m>,
      <m>d = r \cdot t</m>,
      <m>M = D \cdot V</m>) where one of the two quantities being multiplied is no longer constant;
      in each, we consider a small interval for the other variable in the formula,
      calculate the approximate value of the desired quantity (area,
      distance,
      or mass) over the small interval,
      and then use a definite integral to sum the results as the length of the small intervals is allowed to approach zero.
      It should be apparent that this approach will work effectively for other situations where we have a quantity that varies.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="DRM">
      We next turn to the notion of <em>work</em>: 
      <idx><h>work</h></idx>
      from physics,
      a basic principle is that work is the product of force and distance.
      For example,
      if a person exerts a force of 20 pounds to lift a 20-pound weight 4 feet off the ground,
      the total work accomplished is
      <me permid="WFk">
        W = F \cdot d = 20 \cdot 4 = 80 \ \text{foot-pounds}
      </me>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="jYV">
      If force and distance are measured in English units
      (pounds and feet),
      then the units of work are <em>foot-pounds</em>.
      <idx><h>foot-pound</h></idx>
      If we work in metric units,
      where forces are measured in Newtons (where <m> 1 N = 1 \ kg \cdot m/s^2</m>) and distances in meters,
      the units of work are <em>Newton-meters</em>. Note that Newton-meters are also called Joules.
      <idx><h>Newton-meter</h></idx> 
    </p>
    
    <p> Note that gravity pulls on an object of mass <m> m</m> with a force of <m> mg </m>, where <m> g </m> is the gravitational constant <m> g = 9.8 m/s^2 </m>. Since pounds are a unit of force, the value <m> g </m> is already incorporated into the pound. However, grams and kilograms are units of mass, so the force to move them needs to incorporate <m> g </m>.
    </p>
    
    <p> For example, if a  20-kg weight is lifted 4 meters off the ground, the total work accomplished is
      <me permid="WFk">
        W = F \cdot d = (20 \text{ kg})\cdot (9.8 \ m/s^2) \cdot 4 \text{ m} = 784 \ kg \cdot m^2/s^2 = 784 \text{ Newton-meters}
      </me>.
    </p>

    
    <p permid="Qge">
      Of course, the formula <m>W = F \cdot d</m> only applies when the force is constant over the distance <m>d</m>.
      In <xref ref="PA-6-4">Example</xref>,
      we explore one way that we can use a definite integral to compute the total work accomplished when the force exerted varies.

                Since <m>B(h)</m> is changing at a constant rate, it is linear, so we must find
                a linear function with <m>B(0)=20</m> and <m>B(50)=12</m>. Therefore, <m>B(h)</m>
                has an intercept of <m>b=20</m>, and a slope of <m>m=\frac{12-20}{50-0}=-\frac 4{25}</m>

                At <m>h = 5</m>, the bucket weighed <m>B(5)</m> pounds, so if the bucket's weight stopped changing then,
                it would have taken <m>B(5) \Delta h=38.4</m> foot-pounds of work to raise it <m>\Delta h = 2</m> feet.
                Since the bucket's weight actually did not stay constant, this number is slightly off, but since the bucket's weight did not
                change by too much over the time period, it will not be off by much.

                The answer above is an over-estimate of the work it would have taken.
                The answer above would correspond to the bucket's weight remaining constant after <m>h = 5</m>, 
                but since the bucket continued to get lighter after that point, it would have taken less work than our calculation showed.

                This represents the amount of work, in foot-pounds, that it would take to raise the bucket
                from <m>h=0</m> (the bottom of the well) to <m>h=50</m> (the top of the well).
                This calculation provides the right answer because, in order to find the amount of work,
                we'd want to take very thin slices of the form <m>W_{\text{slice} } = B(h) \Delta h</m>,
                sum them, and then take the limit as the slices get thinner (meaning as <m>\Delta h \rightarrow 0 </m>).
                Of course, this would be a Reimann sum, and in the limit as <m>\Delta h \rightarrow 0 </m> it would turn into an integral.

      Because work is calculated by the rule <me>W = F \cdot d</me>
      whenever the force <m>F</m> is constant,
      it follows that we can use a definite integral to compute the work accomplished by a varying force. </p>
      
      <p>
      For example,
      suppose that a bucket whose weight at height <m>h</m> is given by
      <m>B(h) = 12 + 8e^{-0.1h}</m> is being lifted in a 50-foot well.
      In contrast to the problem in <xref ref="PA-6-4">Example</xref>,
      this bucket is not leaking at a constant rate;
      but because the weight of the bucket and water is not constant,
      we have to use a definite integral to determine the total work done in lifting the bucket. </p>
      
      <p>
      At a height <m>h</m> above the water,
      the approximate work to move the bucket a small distance <m>\Delta h</m> is
      <me permid="CMt">
        W_{\text{slice} } = B(h) \Delta h = (12 + 8e^{-0.1h}) \Delta h
      </me>.

    <p permid="oIO">
      Hence, if we let <m>\Delta h</m> tend to 0 and take the sum of all of the slices of work accomplished on these small intervals,
      it follows that the total work is given by

        W = \int_0^{50} B(h) \, dh = \int_0^{50} (12 + 8e^{-0.1h}) \, dh

      In certain geographic locations where the water table is high,
      residential homes with basements have a peculiar feature:
      in the basement, one finds a large hole in the floor,
      and in the hole, there is water.
      For example, in <xref ref="F-6-4-SumpCrock">Figure</xref>
      we see a <em>sump crock</em><fn>

      A sump crock provides an outlet for water that may build up beneath the basement floor

        In the crock we see a floating pump.
        This pump is activated by elevation,
        so when the water level reaches a particular height,
        the pump turns on and pumps water out of the crock,
        hence relieving the water buildup beneath the foundation.
        One of the questions we'd like to answer is:
        how much work does a sump pump accomplish?

          a diameter of 1.5 feet at its base, and a depth of 4 feet.
          In addition,
          suppose that the sump pump is set up so that it pumps the water vertically up a pipe to a drain that is located at ground level just outside a basement window.
          To accomplish this,
          the pump must send the water to a location 9 feet above the surface of the sump crock.
          How much work is required to empty the sump crock if it is initially completely full?

          and the positive <m>y</m>-axis to the right,
          as pictured in the figure.
          Because the pump sits on the surface of the water,
          it makes sense to think about the pump moving the water one
          <q>slice</q> at a time,
          where it takes a thin slice from the surface,

          another 9 feet to reach the drain at ground level.

      The preceding example demonstrates the standard approach to finding the work 
      required to empty a tank filled with liquid.
      The main task in each such problem is to determine the volume of a representative slice,
      followed by the force exerted on the slice,
      as well as the distance such a slice moves.
      In the case where the units are metric,
      there is one key difference:
      in the metric setting, rather than weight,
      we normally first find the mass of a slice.
      For instance, if distance is measured in meters,
      the mass density of water is 1000 kg/m<m>^3</m>.
      In that setting, we can find the mass of a typical slice
      (in kg).
      To determine the force required to move it, we use <m>F = ma</m>,
      where <m>m</m> is the object's mass and <m>a</m> is the gravitational constant <m>9.81</m> N/kg.
      That is, in metric units, the weight density of water is 9810 N/m<m>^3</m>.

    <title>Force due to Hydrostatic Pressure</title>
    <p permid="ZzQ">
      When building a dam,
      engineers need to know how much force water will exert against the face of the dam.
      This force comes from water pressure.
      The pressure a force exerts on a region is measured in units of force per unit of area:
      for example,
      the air pressure in a tire is often measured in pounds per square inch (PSI).
      Hence, we see that the general relationship is given by
      <me permid="zRN">
        P = \frac{F}{A}, \ \text{or}  \ F = P \cdot A
      </me>,
      where <m>P</m> represents pressure,
      <m>F</m> represents force,
      and <m>A</m> the area of the region being considered.
      Of course, in the equation <m>F = PA</m>,
      we assume that the pressure is constant over the entire region <m>A</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="FGZ">
      We know from experience that the deeper one dives underwater while swimming,
      the greater the pressure exerted by the water.
      This is because at a greater depth,
      there is more water right on top of the swimmer:
      it is the force that <q>column</q>
      of water exerts that determines the pressure the swimmer experiences.
      The total water pressure is found by computing the total weight of the column of water that lies above a region of area 1 square foot at a fixed depth.
      At a depth of <m>d</m> feet,
      a rectangular column has volume <m>V = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot d</m> ft<m>^3</m>,
      so the corresponding weight of the water overhead is <m>62.4d</m>.
      This is the amount of force being exerted on a 1 square foot region at a depth <m>d</m> feet underwater,
      so the pressure exerted by water at depth <m>d</m> is <m>P = 62.4 d</m>
      (lbs/ft<m>^2</m>).
    </p>
    
    <p permid="lOi">
      Because pressure is force per unit area,

          Pressure is constant at a fixed depth,

          as shown in the figure.
          The area of this slice is approximately the area of the rectangle pictured.
          Since the width of that rectangle depends on the variable <m>x</m>,
          we find a formula for the line that represents one side of the dam.
          It is straightforward to find that <m>y = 45 - \frac{3}{5}x</m>.

          At any point on this slice,

          the depth of any point on the representative slice is approximately <m>(x-5)</m>.

          Knowing both the pressure and area,

          Finally, we use a definite integral to sum the forces over the appropriate range of <m>x</m>-values.

          we start at <m>x = 5</m> and take slices all the way to the bottom of the dam,

                First, we set up axes and a sketch for one of the ends of the cylindrical tank.
                It is simplest to let ground level correspond to the (horizontal) <m>y</m>-axis with the positive <m>x</m>-axis pointing straight down,
                so that <m>x = 0</m> corresponds to ground level and the value of <m>x</m> tells us the depth of a particular location.
                The circular end of the tank has radius <m>3</m> and is centered at the point <m>(5,0)</m> since its top is <m>2</m> feet underground.
                Thus, the equation of that circle is
