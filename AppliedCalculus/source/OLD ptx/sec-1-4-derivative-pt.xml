  <introduction permid="Owv">
    <p permid="buH">
      The <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>
      of a function is an idea that sits at the foundation of calculus.
      It is a generalization of the notion of instantaneous velocity and measures how fast a particular function is changing at a given point.
      If the original function represents the position of a moving object,
      this instantaneous rate of change is precisely the velocity of the object.
      In other contexts,
      instantaneous rate of change could measure the number of cells added to a bacteria culture per day,
      the number of additional gallons of gasoline consumed upon increasing a car's velocity by one mile per hour,
      or the number of dollars added to a mortgage payment for each percentage point increase in interest rate.
      The instantaneous rate of change can also be interpreted geometrically on the function's graph,
      and this connection is fundamental to many of the main ideas in calculus.
    </p>

    <p permid="HBQ">
      Recall that for a moving object with position function <m>s</m>,
      its average velocity on the time interval <m>t = a</m> to <m>t = a+h</m> is given by the quotient
      <me permid="VFv">
        AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="nIZ">
      In a similar way,
      we make the following definition for an arbitrary function <m>y = f(x)</m>.

    <title>The Derivative of a Function at a Point</title>
    <p permid="geA">
      Just as we defined instantaneous velocity in terms of average velocity,
      we now define the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point in terms of the average rate of change of the function <m>f</m> over related intervals.

      This instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> at <m>a</m>
          <idx><h>instantaneous rate of change</h></idx>
      is called <q>the <em>derivative</em>
      of <m>f</m> at <m>a</m>,</q>

          Let <m>f</m> be a function and <m>x = a</m> a value in the function's domain.

      The next several chapters will be devoted to understanding,
      computing,
      applying, and interpreting derivatives.
      For now, we observe the following important things.
    </p>

    <note permid="aKN">
      <p permid="WKO">
        <ul permid="mZf">
          <li permid="DXq">
            The derivative of <m>f</m> at the value <m>x = a</m> is defined as the limit of the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> as <m>h \to 0</m>.
            This limit depends on both the function <m>f</m> and the point <m>x=a</m>. 
            Since this limit may not exist, not every function has a derivative at every point.
          </li>

          <li permid="kez">
            We say that a function is <em>differentiable</em>
                <idx><h>differentiable</h></idx>
            at <m>x = a</m> if it has a derivative at <m>x = a</m>.
          </li>

          <li permid="QlI">
            The derivative is a generalization of the instantaneous velocity of a position function:
            if <m>y = s(t)</m> is the position function of a moving object,
            <m>s'(a)</m> tells us the instantaneous velocity of the object at time <m>t=a</m>.
          </li>

          <li permid="wsR">
            Because the units of <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> are
            <q>units of <m>f(x)</m> per unit of <m>x</m>,</q>
            the derivative has these same units.
            For instance,
            if <m>s</m> measures position in feet and <m>t</m> measures time in seconds,
            the units on <m>s'(a)</m> are feet per second.
          </li>

          <li permid="cAa">
            The quantity
            <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> represents the slope of the line through
            <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(a+h, f(a+h))</m>.
            When we compute the derivative, we are actually taking the limit of a collection of slopes of lines.
            Thus, the derivative itself represents the slope of a particularly important line.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </note>

    <p permid="ssS">
      We first consider the derivative at a given value as the slope of a certain line at that value.
    </p>

    <p permid="YAb">
      When we compute an instantaneous rate of change,
      we allow the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> to shrink as 
      <m>h \to 0</m>.
      We can think of one endpoint of the interval as
      <q>sliding towards</q> the other.
      In particular,
      provided that <m>f</m> has a derivative at <m>(a,f(a))</m>,
      the point <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m> will approach <m>(a,f(a))</m> as <m>h \to 0</m>.
      Because the process of taking a limit is a dynamic one,
      it can be helpful to use computing technology to visualize it.<fn>
      One option is a Java applet in which the user is able to control the point that is moving.

      <xref ref="F-1-3-SecToTanSeq">Figure</xref> below
      shows a sequence of figures with several different lines through the points <m>(a, f(a))</m> and
      <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m>, generated by different values of <m>h</m>.
      These lines
      (shown in the first three figures in magenta),
      are often called 
          <em>secant lines</em>
          <idx><h>secant line</h></idx>
      to the curve <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      A secant line to a curve is simply a line that passes through two points on the curve.
      For each such line,
      the slope of the secant line is <m>m = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}</m>,
      where the value of <m>h</m> depends on the location of the point we choose.
      We can see in the diagram how, as <m>h \to 0</m>,
      the secant lines start to approach a single line that passes through the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      If the limit of the slopes of the secant lines exists,
      we say that the resulting value is the slope of the
      <em>tangent line</em> to the curve.
      This tangent line
          <idx><h>tangent line</h></idx>
      (shown in the right-most figure in green) to the graph of
      <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point

          The slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> through the point <m>(2,-2)</m> is <m>-3</m>.

      </answer>
      <solution permid="uDE">
        <p permid="FMD">
          From the limit definition, we know that
          <me permid="uif">
            f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="lTM">
          Now we use the rule for <m>f</m>,
          and observe that <m>f(2) = 2 - 2^2 = -2</m> and <m>f(2+h) = (2+h) - (2+h)^2</m>.
          Substituting these values into the limit definition, we have that
          <me permid="apo">
            f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(2+h) - (2+h)^2 -  (-2)}{h}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="SaV">
          In order to evaluate the limit,
          we must simplify the quotient.
          Expanding and distributing in the numerator gives us
          <me permid="Gwx">
            f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2+h - 4 - 4h - h^2 + 2}{h}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="yie">
          Combining like terms, we have
          <me permid="mDG">
            f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{ -3h - h^2}{h}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="epn">
          Next, because <m>h\neq0</m> within the limit, we may remove a common factor of <m>h</m> in both the numerator and denominator and find that
          <me permid="SKP">
            f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} (-3-h)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="Kww">
          Finally, we are able to take the limit as <m>h</m> approaches <m>0</m>,
          and thus conclude that <m>f'(2) = -3</m>.
          We note that <m>f'(2)</m> is the instantaneous 
          rate of change of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(2,-2)</m>.
          It is also the slope of the tangent line to the graph of

          If we view the interval as being <m>[a,a+h]</m> instead of <m>[a,b]</m>,

              Using the sum of two angles identity for the sine function,
