  <introduction permid="VFV">
    <p permid="FrE">
      In all of our studies with derivatives so far,
      we have worked with functions whose formula is given explicitly in terms of <m>x</m>.
      But there are many interesting curves whose equations involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are impossible to solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-7-Intro" permid="Kbx">
      <caption>At left, the circle given by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m>.  In the middle, the portion of the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> that has been highlighted in the box at left.  And at right, the lemniscate given by <m>x^3 - y^3 = 6xy</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/2_7_Intro" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="lyN">
      Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles.
      Because of the circle's symmetry,
      for each <m>x</m>-value that is strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter,
      there are two corresponding <m>y</m>-values.
      For instance, on the left side of <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref> above,
      we have labeled <m>A = (-3,\sqrt{7})</m> and <m>B = (-3,-\sqrt{7})</m>.
      These points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test and indicate
      that it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      However,
      portions of the circle, such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>,
      <em>can</em> be represented explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>.
      Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear,
      so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point.
      Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> at any point on the circle,
      even though we cannot write <m>y</m> explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="RFW">
      We say that the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> defines <m>y</m> <em>implicitly</em>
      as a function of <m>x</m>.
      The graph of the equation can be broken into pieces where each piece can be defined by an explicit function of <m>x</m>.
      For the circle,
      we could choose to take the top half as one function of <m>x</m>,
      namely <m>y = \sqrt{16 - x^2}</m>, and the bottom half as <m>y = -\sqrt{16 - x^2}</m>.
      The equation for the circle defines two
      <term> implicit functions</term> of <m>x</m>.

      is called a <em>lemniscate</em>
          <idx><h>lemniscate</h></idx>
      and is just one of many fascinating possibilities for implicitly given curves.

    <p permid="dUo">
      The question we want to address in this section is <q>how can we find an equation for
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> without an explicit formula for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>?</q>
      The following example reminds us of some ways we can compute derivatives of functions in settings where the function's formula is not known.

    Compute the following derivatives; note that each function you must differentiate is a combination of: explicit functions of <m>x</m>,

<statement>
    <p permid="qiG">
      We begin our exploration of implicit differentiation with the example of the circle described by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m>.
      How can we find a formula for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>?
    </p>

    <p permid="WpP">
      By viewing <m>y</m> as an <em>implicit</em>
      function of <m>x</m>,
      we think of <m>y</m> as some function whose formula <m>f(x)</m> is unknown,
      but which we can differentiate.
      Just as <m>y</m> represents an unknown formula,
      so too its derivative with respect to <m>x</m>,
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, will be
      (at least temporarily)
      unknown.
    </p>

    <p permid="CwY">
      So we view <m>y</m> as an unknown differentiable function of <m>x</m> and
      differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>.
      <me permid="Yfc">
        \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 + y^2 \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 16 \right]
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iEh">
      On the right,
      the derivative of the constant <m>16</m> is <m>0</m>,
      and on the left we can apply the sum rule,
      so it follows that
      <me permid="Eml">
        \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 \right]  + \frac{d}{dx} \left[ y^2 \right] = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OLq">
      Note carefully the different roles being played by <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is the independent variable,
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[x^2\right] = 2x</m>.
      But <m>y</m> is the dependent variable and <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>.
      Recall <xref ref="PA-2-7">Example</xref>,
      where we computed <m>\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)^2]</m>.
      Computing <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]</m> is the same
      and requires the chain rule, 
      by which we find that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y^1 \frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We now have that
      <me permid="ktu">
        2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="uSz">
      We solve this equation for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> by
      subtracting <m>2x</m> from both sides and dividing by <m>2y</m>.
      <me permid="QAD">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x}{2y} = -\frac{x}{y}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="aZI">
      There are several important things to observe about the result that <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.
      First, this expression for the derivative involves both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      This makes sense because 
      there are two corresponding points on the circle for each value of <m>x</m> between <m>-4</m> and <m>4</m>,
      and the slope of the tangent line is different at each of these points.

    <sidebyside widths="50% 46%" margins="0%" valign="middle" permid="JrD">
      <p permid="tdm">
        Second, this formula is entirely consistent with our understanding of circles.
        The slope of the radius from the origin to the point <m>(a,b)</m> is <m>m_r = \frac{b}{a}</m>.
        The tangent line to the circle at <m>(a,b)</m> is perpendicular to the radius,
        and thus has slope <m>m_t = -\frac{a}{b}</m>,
        as shown on the right in <xref ref="F-2-7-Circle">Figure</xref>.
        In particular,
        the slope of the tangent line is zero at <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(0,-4)</m>,
        and is undefined at <m>(-4,0)</m> and <m>(4,0)</m>.
        All of these values are consistent with the formula <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.

    <p permid="zCs">
      It is natural to ask where the tangent line to a curve is vertical or horizontal.
      The slope of a horizontal tangent line must be zero,
      while the slope of a vertical tangent line is undefined.
      Often the formula for
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is expressed as a quotient of functions of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, say
      <me permid="Gby">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="fJB">
      The tangent line is horizontal precisely when the numerator is zero and the denominator is nonzero,
      making the slope of the tangent line zero.
      If we can solve the equation
      <m>p(x,y) = 0</m> for either <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of the other,
      we can substitute that expression into the original equation for the curve.
      This gives an equation in a single variable,
      and if we can solve that equation we can find the point(s) on the curve where <m>p(x,y) = 0</m>.
      At those points, the tangent line is horizontal.
    </p>

    <p permid="LQK">
      Similarly, the tangent line is vertical whenever
      <m>q(x,y) = 0</m> and <m>p(x,y) \ne 0</m>,
      making the slope undefined.

            To find where the tangent line to the curve is horizontal,
            we set <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = 0</m>,

            Since <m>\frac{3+\sqrt3}3\approx 1.57735</m> and <m>\frac{3-\sqrt3}3\approx 0.42265</m>,

            </me>.
            Expanding and combining like terms,
            we see that we need to solve the cubic equation <m>4y^3 - 6y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0</m>.
            From the graph, it appears that <m>y=\frac12</m> is a point at which the tangent line 
            is vertical, and we verify this by plugging it into our cubic equation. 
            The equation then factors as <m>2(2y-1)(y^2-y-1)=0</m>, with the quadratic term 
            having roots <m>y=\frac{1\pm\sqrt5}2</m>.
            Visual inspection of the curve at <m>y=\frac12</m>, <m>y\approx -1.236</m>, and 
            <m>y\approx -0.618</m> reveals that each of these <m>y</m>-values occurs at 
            exactly one point of vertical tangency.<fn> 
            We may wish to find the <m>x</m>-coordinate that corresponds to each such <m>y</m>-value.
            For instance, when <m>y = \frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>x</m> must satisfy
            <m>\frac{1}{2}\big(\frac{1}{4}-1\big)\big(\frac{1}{2}-2\big) = x(x-1)(x-2)</m>,
            or in other words, <m>x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x = \frac{9}{16}</m>.
            We can use technology to verify that there is only one such <m>x</m>,
            and <m>x \approx 2.210</m>.
            Similar work can be done to find the <m>x</m>-values that correspond to <m>y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}</m>.

<p>
Implicit differentiation also gives us tools that we can use to find the derivative of functions that are given explicitly.  
The following example demonstrates the technique for one such function.
</p>
<example>
<p>
Find <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> when <m>y=x^x</m>.
</p>

<p>
We first notice that our previous rules of differentiation do not apply in this case 
because we have a variable in both the base and the exponent of this expression.  
In order to solve this problem, we will need to turn it into an equivalent implicit function.

We begin by taking the natural logarithm of both sides to get <me>\ln(y)=\ln(x^x)</me>.  
Through the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to <me>\ln(y)=x\ln(x).</me>  
Now we can implicitly differentiate both sides, yielding 
<md>
<mrow>\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx} = \mathstrut \amp \ln(x)+x\frac1x</mrow>
<mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \ln(x)+1</mrow>
</md>.
Simplification by collecting and isolating <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> gives us 
<md>  
<mrow>\frac{dy}{dx} = \mathstrut \amp y(\ln(x)+1)</mrow>
<mrow>=\mathstrut \amp x^x(\ln(x)+1)</mrow>
</md>. 
Therefore, <me>\frac{d}{dx}[x^x]=x^x(\ln(x)+1).</me>

        Differentiating both sides of the given equation with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>,
        we see that

        Removing a factor of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> from the lefthand side and dividing to solve for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, we have

        The tangent line is potentially horizontal where the numerator of

        Next, we need to find the coordinates of these points where potential horizontal or vertical tangent lines occur.
        First, we consider the potential horizontal tangent line locations.
        When <m>x = 0</m>, <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0</m>,
        and thus we know <m>y^2(2y + 1 - y^3) = 0</m>,
        from which it follows that <m>y = 0</m>,
        <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y \approx -0.618, 1.618</m>.
        This leads to four points to consider:
        <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(0,-1)</m>,
        <m>(0,-0.618)</m>, and <m>(0,1.618)</m>.
        It is apparent from the graph shown below that the tangent line at <m>(0,0)</m> is not horizontal
        (here both the numerator and denominator of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> are zero),
        but at each of the other three points,
        the tangent line is horizontal.
      </p>

      <p permid="WHX">
        We now reason similarly for the other <m>x</m>-values where the numerator is zero.
        At <m>x = 1</m>, <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 1^4 - 2\cdot 1^3 + 1^2 = 0</m>,
        and here again <m>y = 0</m>, <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y \approx -0.618, 1.618</m>.
        This leads to four potential points where the tangent line is horizontal:
        <m>(1,0)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>,
        <m>(1,-0.618)</m>, and <m>(1,1.618)</m>.
        At <m>(1,0)</m>, there's not a horizontal tangent line,
        but at each of the others there is, as seen in the figure.
        Similar reasoning when <m>x = 0.5</m> shows that <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 0.5^4 - 2\cdot 0.5^3 + 0.5^2 = 0.625</m>,
        from which we find that <m>y \approx -1.0493, 0.2104, 1.6139</m>,
        and thus the three points <m>(0.5,-1.0493)</m>,
        <m>(0.5,0.2104)</m>, <m>(0.5, 1.6139)</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="CPg">
        Returning to where the denominator is zero (<m>y = 0</m> and <m>y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235</m>),
        we now determine points where the tangent line is vertical.
        Is is apparent from the figure below that there are no vertical tangent lines when <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y \approx -0.856</m>,
        so there are two values to pursue:
        <m>y \approx -0.379, 1.235</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="iWp">
        When <m>y \approx -0.379</m>,
        it follows that <m>2(-0.379)^3+(-0.379)^2-(-0.379)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>, so
        <me permid="QSL">
          x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0.0426
        </me>
        from which we find that <m>x \approx -0.1756, 0.2912, 0.7088, 1.1756</m>.
        The figure confirms that there are vertical tangent lines at <m>(-0.1756,-0.379)</m>,
        <m>(0.2912,-0.379)</m>, <m>(0.7088,-0.379)</m>,
        and <m>(1.1756,-0.379)</m>
      </p>

      <p permid="Pdy">
        Lastly, when <m>y \approx 1.235</m>,
        it follows <m>2(1.235)^3+(1.235)^2-(1.235)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>, so
        <me permid="wZU">
          x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 2.4195
        </me>
        and thus via technology, <m>x \approx -0.8437, 1.8437</m>.
        This leads to two additional points at which the tangent line is vertical:
        <m>(-0.8437, 1.235)</m> and <m>(1.8437, 1.235)</m>.

      <p permid="brQ">
        First we need to find the slope of the line tangent to the curve,
        or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
        To do so, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>,
        treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> to obtain
        <md permid="BJN">
          <mrow>\frac{d}{dx} \left( \sin(x+y) + \cos(x-y) \right) &amp;= \frac{d}{dx}(1)</mrow>
          <mrow>\cos(x+y) \left(1+\frac{dy}{dx}\right) - \sin(x-y)\left(1-\frac{dy}{dx}\right) &amp;= 0</mrow>
        </md>.
        Distributing on the left side of the equation,
        <me permid="dhd">
          \cos(x+y) + \cos(x+y)\frac{dy}{dx} - \sin(x-y) + \sin(x-y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
        </me>.
        Removing a factor of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> from two terms on the right and moving the other two terms to the righthand side,
        <me permid="Jom">
          \frac{dy}{dx} \left(\cos(x+y) + \sin(x-y) \right) =  \sin(x-y) - \cos(x+y)
        </me>.
        Therefore,
        <me permid="pvv">
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\sin(x-y) - \cos(x+y)}{\cos(x+y) + \sin(x-y)}
        </me>.
        At the point <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> we have that
        <me permid="VCE">
          \frac{dy}{dx}\biggm|_{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = \frac{\sin(0)-\cos(\pi)}{\cos(\pi) + \sin(0)} = -1
        </me>.
        Therefore, the equation of the line tangent to the curve at the point
        <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> is <m>y = \frac{\pi}{2} - \left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m>.
        A portion of the graph of the curve defined by
        <m>\sin(x+y) + \cos(x-y) = 1</m> and the tangent line to the curve at the point
        <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> are shown in the following figure.
