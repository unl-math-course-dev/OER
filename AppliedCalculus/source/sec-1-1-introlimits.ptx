				<em>This section corresponds to</em>  1.1 Introduction to Limits <em>in the workbook.</em> 
			</p>
			
			<p permid="riI"> Limits are a mathematical construct we can use to describe the behavior of a function near a point.
				Why might we want to consider the behavior near a point instead of at the point?
				Consider the function <m>\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{x^2-25}{x-5}</m>.
				The domain of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>x\neq 5</m>, that is the domain is all <m>x</m> not equal to <m>5</m>.
				Thus we can say that <m>f(5)</m> does not exists (DNE).
				Since we can not plug in <m>x=5</m>, we will instead seek to understand what happens to <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer, but not equal to, <m>5</m>.
				We can try to answer this question by simply plugging in values of <m>x</m> that are getting closer and closer to <m>5</m> into <m>f(x)</m>, see <xref ref="table-1-F-1-1-Ex1g">Table </xref>.

				Observe that as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer, but not equal to <m>5</m>, the function values are getting closer and closer to <m>10</m>.

			<p permid="tTK">
				Instead of filling out a table of values, we could instead look at the graph of a function and ask the same question.
				What happens to the function as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer, but not equal to, a particular value? Consider the function <m>g</m> given by the graph in
				<xref ref="F-1-1-PA1">Figure </xref> below. We can evaluate the function at a variety of points. For example, <m>g(-2)=0</m>, <m>g(-1)=3</m>, and <m>g(0)=1</m>.

				<p>
					A careful look at the graph above shows that <m>g(x)</m> has a hole (or a removable discontinuity) at <m>x=0</m>, making <m>g(0)=1</m> even though the overall shape of the graph might lead us to expect <m>g(0)</m> to be <m>4</m>.
					In fact, you would probably agree that <q>as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer (but NOT equal) to <m>0</m>, <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to <m>4</m>.</q>
				</p>

				<p permid="tTK">
					Both of these examples demonstrate the idea of a limit; that is, both ask the question: what happens to the function as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer, but not equal to, a particular value?

			<subsection permid="BTI">
				<title>The Notion of Limit</title>
				<p permid="NMB"> Limits give us a way to identify a trend in the values of a function as its input variable approaches a particular value of interest.
					We need a precise understanding of what it means to say
					<q>a function <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>.</q>
				</p>

				<p permid="tTK">
					In <xref ref="F-1-1-PA1">Figure</xref>,
					we saw that
					as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer
					(but NOT equal)
					to 0, <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to the value 4.
					At first, this may feel counter-intuitive,
					because the value of <m>g(0)</m> is <m>1</m>, not <m>4</m>.
					Limits describe the behavior of a function
					<em>arbitrarily close to</em> a fixed input
					and are not affected by the value of the function <em>at</em>
					the fixed input.
					<!-- TODO: Check this <fn> tag when I actually have internet, or find a way to make it work -->
					More formally,<fn>
					What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit.
					To be completely precise,
					it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say
					<q>as close to <m>L</m> as we like</q>
					and <q>sufficiently close to <m>a</m>.</q>
					That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.
					That being said, the definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.
					</fn> we say the following.
				</p>

				<assemblage permid="upj"><title>Limit of a Function</title>
					<p permid="kzY">
						If a function <m>f</m> is defined on an interval around <m>c</m>, except perhaps at the point <m>x = c</m>, we define the <term>limit of the function <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></term> to be a number <m>L</m> (if one exists) such that <m>f(x)</m> is as close to <m>L</m> as we want whenever <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>c</m> (but <m>x \neq c</m>).
						If <m>L</m> exists, we write
						<me>
							\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L
						</me>.
						On the other hand, if as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> we cannot make <m>f(x)</m> as close to a single value as we would like,
						then we say that <term><m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m></term>.
					</p>
				</assemblage>

				<p permid="aaT">
					For any function <m>f</m>,
					there are typically three ways to answer the question
					<q>does <m>f</m> have a limit at <m>x = a</m>, and if so,
					what is the limit?</q>
					<ol permid="DIV">
						<li permid="NcH">
							Create a table to look at values that approach <m>a</m> on either side
							(typically using some sort of computing technology),
							and ask if they seem to approach a single value, as we did in the first example in the introduction.
						</li>

						<li permid="tjQ">
							Look at the graph of the function and see what value the function is approaching as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> on either side.
						</li>

						<li permid="tjQ">
							Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach <m>a</m>.
						</li>
					</ol>
					The first approach can be tedious and should only be used for functions that you can not use the second two approaches.
					If you can write a computer program to do this then it can be a very useful approach.

								For the function <m>g</m> pictured in <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1prime">Figure</xref>,
								we make the following observations:
								<me permid="juF">
									\lim_{x \to -1} g(x) = 3, \ \lim_{x \to 0} g(x) = 4, \ \text{and} \ \lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = 1
								</me>.
								When finding a limit from a graph,
								it suffices to ask if the function <em>approaches</em>
								a single value from each side of the fixed input.
								The function value <em>at</em> the fixed input is irrelevant.
								This reasoning explains the values of the three limits stated above.
							</p>

							<p permid="wOq">
								We further observe that <m>g</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m>
								because there is a jump in the graph at <m>x = 1</m>.
								If we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the left,
								the function values tend to get close to 3,
								but if we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the right,
								the function values get close to 2.
								There is no single number that all of these function values approach.
								This is why the limit of <m>g</m> does not exist at <m>x = 1</m>.

									We define a limit from the left and a limit from the right in the same way as above, while adding the stipulation that <m>x\lt c</m> for the left limit and <m>x\gt c</m> for the right limit.
									That is, as we move <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>c</m> <em>from the left</em> on a number line (<m>x\lt c</m>), <m>f(x)</m> gets as close to the limit value as we want.
