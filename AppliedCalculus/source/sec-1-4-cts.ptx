			<introduction>
				<p>
					In this section we introduce the idea of a continuous function.
					Many of the results in calculus require that the functions be continuous, so having a strong understanding of continuous functions will be very important.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<subsection permid="gHq">
				<title>Being Continuous at a Point</title>
				<idx><h>continuous</h></idx>
				<p permid="AeI">
					Intuitively,
					a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without ever lifting our pencil from the page.
					Alternatively,
					we might say that the graph of a continuous function has no jumps or holes in it.
				</p>

				<figure xml:id="F-1-1-Cont" permid="kVK">
					<caption>Functions <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, and <m>h</m> that demonstrate subtly different behaviors at <m>a = 1</m>.</caption>
					<image width="100%" source="1_7_Cont" />
					</figure>

					<p>
						First consider the function in the left-most graph in <xref ref="F-1-1-Cont">Figure</xref>.
						Note that <m>f(1)</m> is not defined,
						which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>a = 1</m>.
						If you were to draw the graph of <m>f</m> yourself then you would need to lift your pencil when you reached <m>f(1)</m>.
						We will naturally say that <m>f</m> is
						<em>not continuous at <m>a = 1</m></em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						For the function <m>g</m> in <xref ref="F-1-1-Cont">Figure</xref>,
						we observe that while <m>g(1)</m> is defined,
						the value of <m>g(1) = 2</m> is not what you would <q>expect.</q>  Specifically, you would expect <m>g(1)</m> to be 3, not 2.
						Thus, to draw the graph of <m>g</m> you would need to lift your pencil at <m>a=1</m>.
						Again, we will say that <m>g</m> is
						<em>not continuous</em> at <m>a=1</m>,
						even though the function is defined at <m>a = 1</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, the function <m>h</m> in <xref ref="F-1-1-Cont">Figure</xref> appears to be the most <q>well-behaved</q> of all three,
						since at <m>a = 1</m> the function value is what you might expect it to be if you were to try and draw the graph of the function without lifting your pencil.
						In this case we would say that <m>h</m> is continuous at <m>a=1</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						The above examples demonstrate a discontinuity commonly know as a <em>removable discontinuity</em>.
						This is, however, not the only way in which a function can be discontinuous.
						Another type of discontinuity is the so-called <em>jump</em> discontinuity illustrated below in <xref ref="F-1-2-Cont">Figure</xref>.
					</p>

					<figure xml:id="F-1-2-Cont" permid="kVK">
						<caption>Places where functions make a <q>jump</q> also produce discontinuities.</caption>
						<image width="50%" source="Piecewise.jpg" />
						</figure>

						<p>
							A third type of discontinuity is the so-called <em>infinite</em> discontinuity.
							Infinite discontinuities exist at points where the values of a function diverge to infinity.
							A classic example of an infinite discontinuity is the point <m>x=0</m> for the function <m>\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{1}{x}</m>;
							you can see the behavior of the infinite discontinuity in the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> in <xref ref="F-1-3-Cont">Figure</xref>.
						</p>

							<title>Limits and Continuity</title>
							<p permid="AeI">
								Using limits, we can formalize the idea of continuity.
								Let us start by re-examining our first example given in <xref ref="F-1-1-Cont">Figure</xref>.
							</p>

							<p permid="glR">
								Consider the function in the left-most graph of <xref ref="F-1-1-Cont">Figure</xref>.
								We noted that <m>f(1)</m> is not defined, or <m>f(1)=DNE</m>, thus <m>f</m> is <em>not continuous at <m>c = 1</m></em>.
								For the function <m>g</m>,
								we observe that while <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 3</m>,
								the value of <m>g(1)</m> is <m>2</m>,
								and thus <em>the limit does not equal the function value</em>.
								Here, too, we will say that <m>g</m> is
								<em>not continuous</em>,
								even though the function is defined at <m>c = 1</m>.
								Finally, the function <m>h</m> appears to be the most well-behaved of all three,
								since at <m>c = 1</m> its limit and its function value agree.
								That is,
								<me permid="SSg">
									\lim_{x \to 1} h(x) = 3 = h(1)
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p permid="Mta">
								With no hole or jump in the graph of <m>h</m> at <m>c = 1</m>,
								we say that <m>h</m> is
								<em>continuous</em> there.
							</p>

							<p>
								In <xref ref="F-1-2-Cont">Figure</xref> we have what we called a jump discontinuity.
								Note that at the location of each jump:
								<me>
									\lim_{x\to c^-} y \neq \lim_{x\to c^+}y,
								</me>
								thus at each point that the graph of had a jump the <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c} y=DNE.</m>
							</p>

							<p>
								Similarly in <xref ref="F-1-3-Cont">Figure</xref> we noted that the function was discontinuous at <m>x=0</m> again
								<me>
									\lim_{x\to 0^-} f(x) \neq \lim_{x\to 0^+}f(x),
								</me>
								thus the <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0} f(x)=DNE.</m>
							</p>

							<p>
								From these three examples we see that in order for a function to be continuous we need the limit to exist at the point.
								More formally, we make the following definition.
							</p>

							<assemblage>
								<title>Continuous Function</title>
								<idx><h>continuous</h><h>at <m>x = c</m></h></idx>
								<p permid="ewE">
									A function <m>f</m> is <term>continuous at <m>x = c</m></term>
									provided that
									<ol marker="a." permid="qbc">
										<li permid="XXy">
											<p permid="oVJ">
												<m>f</m> has a limit as <m>x \to c</m>,
											</p>
										</li>

										<li permid="EeH">
											<p permid="VcS">
												<m>f</m> is defined at <m>x = c</m>, and
											</p>
										</li>

										<li permid="klQ">
											<p permid="Bkb">
												<m>\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)</m>.
											</p>
										</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
							</assemblage>

							<p permid="sAj">
								Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c),
								but we state them explicitly to emphasize their individual importance.
								The definition says that a function is continuous at <m>x = c</m> provided that its limit as <m>x \to c</m> exists and equals its function value at <m>x = c</m>.
								Applying this definition to the types of discontinuities we have looked we can observe the following:
								<ul>
									<li permid="yZp">
										If the graph of a function has a hole at <m>x=a</m> then <m>f(a)=DNE </m>.
									</li>

									<li permid="yZp">
										If the graph of a function has an asymptote at <m>x=a</m> then <m>f(a)=DNE</m> or <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a}f(x)=DNE</m>.
									</li>

									<li permid="yZp">
										If the graph of a function has an jump at <m>x=a</m> then <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=DNE</m>.
									</li>

									<li permid="yZp">
										If the graph of a function has a hole with a value at another y-value at <m>x=a</m> then <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a}f(x)\neq f(a)</m>.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<assemblage>
								<title>Continuous Function</title>
								<p>
									A function is said to be <term>continuous on an interval <m>[a,b]</m></term> if the <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)</m> at every point <m>x=c</m> on the interval.
									That is, the function has no points of discontinuity on that interval.
								</p>

								<p>
									<alert>Note:</alert>
									A function is continuous if nearby values of the independent variable give nearby values of the function.
									In practical work, continuity is important because it means that small errors in the independent variable lead to smalls errors in the function.
								</p>
							</assemblage>

							<p>
								If a function is continuous at every point in an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
								we say the function is <q>continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>.</q>
								If a function is continuous at every point in its domain,
								we simply say the function is <q>continuous.</q> Thus we note that
								continuous functions are particularly nice:
								to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point,
								all we need to do is evaluate the function.
							</p>

							<p permid="YHs">
								For example, consider <m>p(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3</m>.
								It can be proved that every polynomial is a continuous function at every real number,
								and thus if we would like to know <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 2} p(x)</m>,
								we simply compute
								<me permid="yZp">
									\lim_{x \to 2} (x^2 - 2x + 3) = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 2 + 3 = 3 = p(2)
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p permid="EOB">
								This route of substituting an input value to evaluate a limit works whenever we know that the function being considered is continuous.
								Besides polynomial functions,
								all exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions are continuous at every point,
								as are many other familiar functions and combinations thereof.
							</p>

							<example>
								<statement>
									<p>
										Consider the function
										<me>
											f(x)=\frac{3x(x+4)}{x^2-16}
										</me>.
										Are there <m>x</m>-values where the function is discontinuous?  If so, how do those  <m>x</m>-values fail the limit definition of continuity?
									</p>
								</statement>

								<hint>
									<p>
										Consider the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>.
									</p>

									<figure>
										<caption>A plot of the function <m>y=f(x)</m>.</caption>
										<image width="50%" source="0-4-rational.jpg" />
										</figure>
									</hint>

									<answer>
										<p>
											<m>f(x)</m> is discontinuous at <m>x=4, -4</m>.
											At both points <m>f(4)=DNE</m> and <m>f(-4)=DNE</m>.
											Also <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to4}f(x)=DNE</m>.
										</p>
									</answer>

									<solution>
										<p>
											We first consider a graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>, shown below.
										</p>

										<figure>
											<caption>A plot of the function <m>y=f(x)</m>.</caption>
											<image width="50%" source="0-4-rational.jpg" />
											</figure>

											<p>
												Visual inspection of the graph certainly indicates discontinuities.
												However, we can make our visual inspection more precise through a little algebra.
												We start by expanding the numerator and denominator of the function.
												Specifically, we have
												<me>
													f(x)=\frac{3x(x+4)}{x^2-16}=\frac{3x(x+4)}{(x+4)(x-4)}.
												</me>
												From here we see that there are two <m>x</m>-values at which the function is undefined: at <m>x=-4,4</m>, that is <m>f(x)=DNE</m> at these points hence the function is not continuous.

										<solution>
											<p>
												For a piecewise function we must examine the point where the function changes.
												To do so we will examine the right and left hand limits.
												Here we use the fact that to the left of 1, that is <m>x\lt1</m> the function is defined as <m>f(x)=x+1</m>.
												To the right of 1, that is <m>x\gt 1</m> the function is defined as <m>f(x)=3</m>.
												Thus:
												<me permid="yZp">
													\lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x)=\lim_{x \to 1^-} x+1=1+1=2
												</me>.
												<me permid="yZp">
													\lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x)=\lim_{x \to 1^+} 3=3
												</me>.
												Since the two sides are not the same
												<me permid="yZp">
													\lim_{x \to 1} f(x)=DNE
												</me>.
												So the function <m>f(x)</m> is not continuous at <m>x=1</m>.

										The jumps that a piecewise function possesses make piecewise functions a natural place in which to explore continuity.

											</p>
										</answer>

										<solution>
											<p>
												For a piecewise function we must examine the point where the function changes.
												To do so we will examine the right and left hand limits.
												Here we use the fact that to the left of 2, that is <m>x\lt2</m> the function is defined as <m>h(x)=4x^2</m>.
												To the right of 2, that is <m>x\gt 2</m> the function is defined as <m>h(x)=5x+6</m>.
												Thus:
												<me permid="yZp">
													\lim_{x \to 2^-} h(x)=\lim_{x \to 2^-} 4x^2=4(2)^2=16
												</me>.
												<me permid="yZp">
													\lim_{x \to 2^+} h(x)=\lim_{x \to 2^+} 5x+6=5(2)+6=16
												</me>.
												Since the two sides are the same
												<me permid="yZp">
													\lim_{x \to 2} h(x)=16
												</me>.
												So the function <m>h(x)</m> is  continuous at <m>x=2</m>, and since each piece is a polynomial this function is continuous  on the interval <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>, that is for all values of <m>x</m>.

										Not only can we ask questions about when a piecewise function is continuous but we can also ask questions about how to make a piecewise function continuous by varying parameters.
									</p>

									<example>
										<statement>
											<p>
												Consider the piecewise function
												<me>
													D(x)=\begin{cases}
													4x^2-k\amp\text{ if } x \lt 2,\\

												Find the value of <m>k</m> to make this function continuous for all <m>x</m>.

											<p>
												Consider the limit from the left and the limit from the right at <m>x=2</m>.
											</p>
										</hint>

										<answer>
											<p>
												<m>k=5</m>
											</p>
										</answer>

										<solution>
											<p>
												To determine a value of <m>k</m> to make <m>D(x)</m> continuous  we will examine the right and left hand limits at <m>x=2</m>.
												Here we use the fact that to the left of 2, that is <m>x\lt2</m> the function is defined as <m>D(x)=4x^2-k</m>.
												To the right of 2, that is <m>x\gt 2</m> the function is defined as <m>D(x)=kx+1</m>.
												Thus:
												<me permid="yZp">
													\lim_{x \to 2^-} D(x)=\lim_{x \to 2^-} 4x^2-k=4(2)^2-k=16-k
												</me>.
												<me permid="yZp">
													\lim_{x \to 2^+} D(x)=\lim_{x \to 2^+} kx+1=k(2)+1=2k+1

												In order for <m>D(x)</m> to be continuous need the two sides to be equal, thus set them equal and solve for <m>k</m>.
												<me permid="yZp">
													16-k=2k+1

										<title>Continuity of Composite Functions</title>

									<title>Summary of Limits and Continuity</title>
									<p>
										The concepts discussed in the last two sections will be important in later sections.
										The following is a short summary of these sections and an example that ties together the concepts of limits and continuity.
										<ul>
											<li>
												For a function <m>f</m> defined on an interval around a number <m>c</m>,
												<me>
													\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L
												</me>
												means that the value of <m>f(x)</m> gets as close as we want to a number <m>L</m> whenever <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>c</m>, assuming the value <m>L</m> exists.
											</li>

											<li>
												We define a limit from the left and a limit from the right in the same way as above, while adding the stipulation that <m>x\lt c</m> for the left limit and <m>x\gt c</m> for the right limit.
												That is, as we move <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>c</m> <em>from the left</em> on a number line (<m>x\lt c</m>), <m>f(x)</m> gets as close to the limit value as we want.
												Similarly for the limit from the right.
											</li>

											<li>
												The one-sided limits help to determine if a limit exists as <m>x</m> approaches a value <m>c</m>.
												More specifically, <m>\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L</m> if and only if <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c^-} f(x)=L=\lim_{x \rightarrow c^+} f(x)</m>
											</li>

											<li>
												Limits also help us determine the continuity of a function at a point <m>x=c</m>.
												A function <m>f</m> that has a limit as <m>x\rightarrow c</m>, is defined at <m>x=c</m>, and <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)=f(c)</m> is continuous at <m>x=c</m>.
											</li>
										</ul>
