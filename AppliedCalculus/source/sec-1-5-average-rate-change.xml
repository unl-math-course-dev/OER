  <introduction permid="Owv">
    <p permid="buH">
      The <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>
      of a function is an idea that sits at the foundation of calculus.
    The  instantaneous rate of change could measure the number of cells added to a bacteria culture per day,
      the number of additional gallons of gasoline consumed upon increasing a car's velocity by one mile per hour,
      or the number of dollars added to a mortgage payment for each percentage point increase in interest rate.
      The instantaneous rate of change can also be interpreted geometrically on the function's graph,
      and this connection is fundamental to many of the main ideas in calculus.

    </p>

    <p permid="nIZ">
    To determine the instantaneous rate of change, we must first examine the <em>average rate of change</em> of a function.
      We make the following definition for an arbitrary function <m>y = f(x)</m>.

          For a function <m>f</m>, the <term>average rate of change

In <xref ref="AvgRate-1-1">Example</xref> we note that the average rate of change varied greatly depending on the interval over which it was evaluated.

    Notice that in the numerator we have the values <m>s(1)</m> and <m>s(0.5)</m>,

    <m>t=1</m> and <m>t=0.5</m>, both measured in seconds. The units of the quotient, then, 
    should be feet per second. These are units of velocity, and in fact the value of 
    <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m> is the average velocity on the time interval <m>0.5\le t\le1</m>.
    Moreover, the formula for <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m> is precisely the slope formula between 
    the points <m>(0.5,s(0.5))</m> and <m>(1,s(1))</m>.

    <assemblage xml:id="aroc-def2" >
    <title>Average Rate of Change</title>
        <p permid="iZg">
          For a function <m>f</m>, the <term>average rate of change
          of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m></term> is given by the formula
          <me permid="BME">
            AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
          </me>.
        </p>
    </assemblage>
<p> The purpose of rewriting the average rate of change in this manner is to be able to understand <term> the instantaneous rate of change </term> of a function at a particular point. </p>

<p>
      As we saw in the examples above, the average rate of change is the slope of the line connecting the points <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m>. We call this line the   <em>secant line</em>, the slope of the secant line is <m>m = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}</m>, or in other words <term> the average rate of change is the slope of the secant line</term>. </p>

<p>      To compute an <term> instantaneous rate of change </term>,
      we allow the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> to shrink as 
      <m>h \to 0</m>.
      We can think of one endpoint of the interval as
      <q>sliding towards</q> the other. 
      In particular,
      provided that <m>f</m> has a derivative at <m>(a,f(a))</m>,
      the point <m>(a+h,f(a+h))</m> will approach <m>(a,f(a))</m> as <m>h \to 0</m>.
      Because the process of taking a limit is a dynamic one,
      it can be helpful to visualize it.</p>

          The average rate of change of a function <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is <m>\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}</m>.
          The units on the average rate of change are units of <m>f(x)</m> per unit of <m>x</m>,
