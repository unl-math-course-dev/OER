			In <xref ref="sec-3-5-implicit">Section</xref> we saw that <m>y</m> can be defined implicitly as a function of <m>x</m> and that it was possible to find the rate of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>, that is <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m>, without explicitly solving for <m>y</m>.
			It is also possible for both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to be defined as implicit functions of time <m>(t)</m>; that is, both variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> implicitly change with time.
			When two variables change in time, it is possible to find the rate of change of one variable given the rate of change of the second variable; these are known as <em>related rates</em>.

			We will start  by examining an example without context to understand the process, then move on to applications in which we use related rates.

			In looking at applications of related rates we will start with an application to Business.
			We have seen that we can determine Profit, Revenue, and Cost as functions of the number of items sold <m>(x)</m>; however, in the real world the number of items that are produced and sold is always changing in time.
			We can apply the idea of related rates to understand how  Profit, Revenue, or Cost change in time given how the number of items changes in time.

					Find the rate of change of profit <m>\displaystyle \frac{dP}{dt}</m> when <m>40</m> items are sold (i.e.

							<p permid="rZT">
								Starting with the equation <m>V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>, we differentiate both sides with respect to <m>t</m>.
								We need to use the chain rule to differentiate the right side of the equation since <m>r</m> is really <m>r(t)</m>, a function of <m>t</m>.

						<li permid="Txj">
							<p permid="Yhc">
								Since the units are cubic inches per second, this is a volume rate.
								So, <m>\frac{dV}{dt}=20</m> cubic inches per second.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li permid="zEs">
							<p permid="Eol">
								Since <m>\frac{dV}{dt}=20</m> and <m>r=6</m> when <m>d=12</m>, we have <m>20=4\pi(6)^2\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
								Solving this equation for <m> \frac{dr}{dt}</m>, we have <m>\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{5}{36\pi}</m> inches per second.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li permid="fLB">
							<p permid="kvu">
								Doing the same thing as in part (c), we find that <m>\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{5}{64\pi}</m> inches per second when the diameter is <m>16</m> inches (the only difference in our equation here is that <m>r=8</m>).
								This number is smaller than the one calculated in part (c), so the radius is changing more rapidly when the diameter is <m>12</m> inches.
								Intuitively, this makes sense since the balloon's volume is growing at a constant rate: as the balloon grows, a small change in the radius will have a larger impact on the change in volume; equivalently, the same change in volume corresponds to a smaller change in the radius when the balloon is large.

									The variables in this problem are the volume <m>V</m> of water in the pool and the depth <m>y</m> of water in the pool (measured at the deepest point of the pool);

									We are given that <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> is a constant <m>800</m> cubic feet per minute and want to find <m>\frac{dh}{dt}\bigm|_{h=5}</m>.
									To do this, we first need to relate <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.
									The volume of the water in the pool at height

									<p permid="uWM">
										Placing the cross section on a coordinate system as in the figure,

										This line has slope <m>\frac{12}{60} = 0.2</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,-15)</m>.
										So the equation of this line is <m>y = 0.2x-15</m>.
										It is the <m>x</m> coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>h-15</m> that is the length of the triangle whose height is <m>h</m>.
										So the length <m>l</m> is <m>l = \frac{(h-15)+15}{0.2} = 5h</m>.
										Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height <m>h</m> is
										<me permid="tRt">
											V = \left(\frac{1}{2}(h)(5h)\right)(25) = 62.5h^2
