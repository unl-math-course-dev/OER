	<introduction permid="VFV">
		<p permid="FrE">
			In all of our studies with derivatives so far,
			we have worked with functions whose formula is given explicitly in terms of <m>x</m>.
			But there are many interesting curves whose equations involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are impossible to solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
		</p>

		<figure xml:id="F-2-7-Intro" permid="Kbx">
			<caption>At left, the circle given by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m>.
			In the middle, the portion of the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> that has been highlighted in the box at left.
			And at right, the lemniscate given by <m>x^3 - y^3 = 6xy</m>.</caption>
			<image width="100%" source="2_7_Intro" />
			</figure>

			<p permid="lyN">
				Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles.
				Because of the circle's symmetry,
				for each <m>x</m>-value that is strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter,
				there are two corresponding <m>y</m>-values.
				For instance, on the left side of <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref> above,
				we have labeled <m>A = (-3,\sqrt{7})</m> and <m>B = (-3,-\sqrt{7})</m>.
				These points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test and indicate
				that it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form <m>y = f(x)</m>.
				However,
				portions of the circle, such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>,
				<em>can</em> be represented explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>.
				Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear,
				so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point.
				Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute
				<m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m> at any point on the circle,
				even though we cannot write <m>y</m> explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>.
			</p>

			<p permid="RFW">
				We say that the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> defines <m>y</m> <em>implicitly</em>
				as a function of <m>x</m>.
				The graph of the equation can be broken into pieces where each piece can be defined by an explicit function of <m>x</m>.
				For the circle,
				we could choose to take the top half as one function of <m>x</m>,
				namely <m>y = \sqrt{16 - x^2}</m>, and the bottom half as <m>y = -\sqrt{16 - x^2}</m>, both of which are explicit functions.
				So, the implicit function <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> defines two explicit functions of <m> x </m>.

			<p permid="dUo">
				The question we want to address in this section is <q>how can we find an equation for
				<m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m> without an explicit formula for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>?</q>

					<p permid="qiG">
						We begin our exploration of implicit differentiation with the example of the circle described by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m>.
						How can we find a formula for <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m>?
					</p>

					<p permid="WpP">
						By viewing <m>y</m> as an <em>implicit</em>
						function of <m>x</m>,
						we think of <m>y</m> as some function whose formula <m>f(x)</m> is unknown,
						but which we can differentiate.
						Just as <m>y</m> represents an unknown formula,
						so too its derivative with respect to <m>x</m>,
						<m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m>, will be
						(at least temporarily)
						unknown.
					</p>

					<p permid="CwY">
						So we view <m>y</m> as an unknown differentiable function of <m>x</m> and
						differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>.
						<me permid="Yfc">
							\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 + y^2 \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 16 \right]
						</me>.
					</p>

					<p permid="iEh">
						On the right,
						the derivative of the constant <m>16</m> is <m>0</m>,
						and on the left we can apply the sum rule,
						so it follows that
						<me permid="Eml">
							\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 \right]  + \frac{d}{dx} \left[ y^2 \right] = 0
						</me>.
					</p>

					<p permid="OLq">
						Note carefully the different roles being played by <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
						Because <m>x</m> is the independent variable,
						<m>\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} \left[x^2\right] = 2x</m>.
						But <m>y</m> is the dependent variable and <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>.
						Recall <xref ref="PA-2-7">Example</xref>,
						where we computed <m>\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)^2]</m>.
						Computing <m>\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[y^2]</m> is the same
						and requires the chain rule,
						by which we find that <m>\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y^1 \frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
						We now have that
						<me permid="ktu">
							2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
						</me>.
					</p>

					<p permid="uSz">
						We solve this equation for <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m> by
						subtracting <m>2x</m> from both sides and dividing by <m>2y</m>.
						<me permid="QAD">
							\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x}{2y} = -\frac{x}{y}
						</me>.
					</p>

					<p permid="aZI">
						It is important to observe that this expression for the derivative involves both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
						This makes sense because
						there are two corresponding points on the circle for each value of <m>x</m> between <m>-4</m> and <m>4</m>,
						and the slope of the tangent line is different at each of these points.

					<!-- <sidebyside widths="50% 46%" margins="0%" valign="middle" permid="JrD">
					<p permid="tdm">
						Second, this formula is entirely consistent with our understanding of circles.
						The slope of the radius from the origin to the point <m>(a,b)</m> is <m>\displaystyle m_r = \frac{b}{a}</m>.
						The tangent line to the circle at <m>(a,b)</m> is perpendicular to the radius,
						and thus has slope <m>\displaystyle m_t = -\frac{a}{b}</m>,
						as shown on the right in <xref ref="F-2-7-Circle">Figure</xref>.
						In particular,
						the slope of the tangent line is zero at <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(0,-4)</m>,
						and is undefined at <m>(-4,0)</m> and <m>(4,0)</m>.
						All of these values are consistent with the formula <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.
