	<title>The Sealed Bids Method of Fair Division</title>
	<p>
		The Sealed Bids method provides a method for discrete fair division, allowing for the division of items that cannot be split into smaller pieces, like a house or a car.
		Because of this, the method requires that all parties have a large amount of cash at their disposal to balance out the difference in item values.
	</p>

	<assemblage>
		<p>
			The method begins by compiling a list of items to be divided.
			Then:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Each party involved lists, in secret, a dollar amount they value each item to be worth.
					This is their sealed bid.
				</li>

				<li>
					The bids are collected.
					For each party, the value of all the items is totaled, and divided by the number of parties.
					This defines their fair share.
				</li>

				<li>
					Each item is awarded to the highest bidder.
				</li>

				<li>
					For each party, the value of all items received is totaled.
					If the value is more than that party's fair share, they pay the difference into a holding pile.
					If the value is less than that party's fair share, they receive the difference from the holding pile.
					This ends the initial allocation.
				</li>

				<li>
					In most cases, there will be a surplus, or leftover money, in the holding pile.
					The surplus is divided evenly between all the players.
					This produces the final allocation.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<p>
		While the assumptions we made for fair division methods specified that an arbitrator should not be necessary, it is common for an independent third party to collect the bids and announce the outcome.
		While not technically necessary, since the method can be executed without a third party involved, this protects the secrecy of the bids, which can sometimes help avoid resentment or bad feelings between the players.

	<example xml:id="sam-omar-sealedbid">
		<p>
			Sam and Omar have lived together for the last 3 years, during which time they shared the expense of purchasing several items for their home.
			Sam has accepted a job in another city, and now they find themselves needing to divide their shared assets.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each records their value of each item, as shown below.
		</p>

				</row>
			</tabular>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			Use the sealed bids procedure to allocate the items between Sam and Omar.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sam's total valuation of the items is $150+$200+$250+$50 = $650, making a fair share for Sam $650 <solidus/> 2 = $325.
		</p>

		<p>
			Omar's total valuation of the items is $100+$250+$150+$100 = $600, making a fair share for Omar $600 <solidus/> 2 = $300.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each item is now awarded to the highest bidder.
			Sam will receive the couch and video game system, providing $150+$250 = $400 of value to Sam.
			Since this exceeds his fair share, he has to pay the difference, $75, into a holding pile.
		</p>

		<p>
			Omar will receive the TV and surround sound system, providing $250+$100=$350 in value.
			This is more than his fair share, so he has to pay the difference, $50, into the holding pile.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thus, in the initial allocation, Sam receives the couch and video game system and pays $75 into the holding pile.
			Omar receives the TV and surround sound system and pays $50 into the holding pile.
			At this point, both players would feel they have received a fair share.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is now $125 remaining in the holding pile.
			This is the surplus from the division.
			This is now split evenly, and both Sam and Omar are given back $62.50.
			Since Sam had paid in $75, the net effect is that he paid $12.50.
			Since Omar had originally paid in $50, the net effect is that he receives $12.50.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thus, in the final allocation, Sam receives the couch and video game system and pays $12.50 to Omar.
			Omar receives the TV and surround sound system and receives $12.50.
			At this point, both players feel they have received more than a fair share.

		<p>
			The items would then be allocated to the company that bid the most for each:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Company name would be awarded to Graphix

				<li>
					Company location would be awarded to DesignByMe
				</li>

				<li>
					CEO would be awarded to Super Designs

			In the table below, we calculate the first and final settlements.
			Recall that all amounts are in <em>thousands</em> of dollars.
			Note that after the first settlement, the total surplus is <m>2.50+3.25-5.50+7.25 = 7.50 </m>, so each company gets <m>7.50/4=1.875</m> as their extra share.

			<p>
				The fair shares are:

					<li>
						Jamal's total value is $250 + $170 + $300 = $720.
						His fair share is $240 thousand.

						Her fair share is $245 thousand.

					<li>
						Kendra's total value is$280 + $200 + $270 = $750.
						Her fair share is $250 thousand.

				</ul>
				In the first settlement,
				<ul>
					<li>
						Jamal receives the business, and pays $300 - $240 = $60 thousand into holding.

					<li>
						Maggie receives the house, and pays $300 - $245 = $55 thousand into holding.

					<li>
						Kendra receives the vacation home, and gets $250 - $200 = $50 thousand from holding.

				There is a surplus of $60 + $55 - $50 = $65 thousand in holding, so each person will receive $21,667 from surplus.

	<p>
		Fair division does not always have to be used for items of value.
		It can also be used to divide undesirable items.
		To do so, we simply follow the same procedure but assign the items negative values.
		We illustrate this in the following example.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="chores-sealedbid">
		<p>
			Suppose Chelsea and Mariah are sharing an apartment, and need to split the chores for the household.
			They list the chores, assigning a negative dollar value to each item; in other words, the amount they would pay for someone else to do the chore (a per week amount).
			We will assume, however, that they are committed to doing all the chores themselves and not hiring someone else.
		</p>

		<sidebyside>
			<tabular top="minor" bottom="minor" left="minor" right="minor">
				<row bottom="medium">
				<cell right="medium"></cell>
				<cell>Chelsea</cell>
				<cell>Mariah</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
				<cell right="medium">Vacuuming</cell>
				<cell><ndash/>$10</cell>
				<cell><ndash/>$8</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
				<cell right="medium">Cleaning the bathroom</cell>

				</row>
				<row>
				<cell right="medium">Dusting</cell>
				<cell><ndash/>$6</cell>
				<cell><ndash/>$4</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			Now we award each item to the player who bid the highest<mdash/>but remember that the values are negative.
			So, for example, <ndash/>$8 is <em>greater</em> than <ndash/>$10, and thus Mariah is <q>awarded</q> the vacuuming.
			This makes sense, since her value of <ndash/>$8 indicates that she dislikes it less than Chelsea, who valued it at <ndash/>$10.
			Similarly, we give cleaning the bathroom and doing the dishes to Chelsea, while Mariah also gets dusting.
			Now we can find the first and final settlements, given in the table below.

		<p>
			The overall surplus is 7<ndash/>1=6, so each player receives a surplus of 6 <solidus/> 2=3, giving the final settlement values shown in the table above.
			Notice that the cash in the final settlement comes out even: Mariah pays Chelsea $4, with nothing left over.
			This is a good way to check we've done our math right.
