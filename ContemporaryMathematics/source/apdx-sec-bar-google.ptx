	<title>How to make a bar graph in Google Sheets</title>
	<p>
		This tutorial uses the following data set.
		It contains the scores on a 5 point quiz for a class of 18 students.
	</p>

	<table xml:id="tutorial-table2">
		<title>Number of students who earned each score</title>
		<tabular top="minor" bottom="minor" left="minor" right="minor">
			<row>
			<cell>Score</cell>
			<cell>5</cell>
			<cell>4</cell>
			<cell>3</cell>
			<cell>2</cell>
			<cell>1</cell>
			<cell>0</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
			<cell>Count</cell>
			<cell>6</cell>
			<cell>2</cell>
			<cell>3</cell>
			<cell>0</cell>
			<cell>2</cell>
			<cell>5</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
	</table>

	<p>
		You can follow the steps below by looking at the mean and standard deviation tab of the sample spreadsheet.
		If you are using Google Sheets, the example is found by <url href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_wnEQl5btBz6646XbhOrjyAYLRntf7dCunb-qRUJBDM/edit?usp=sharing">clicking here</url>.

		<li>
			<title>Part 1: Enter the data</title>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Write headings VALUE, COUNT, PERCENT in A1, B1, C1.
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Enter the values, taking advantage of the fact that the values all differ by the same amount.
							<ol>
								<li>
									Write the score 0 in A2.
								</li>

								<li>
									Write =A2+1 in A3.
								</li>

								<li>
									Click the lower-right corner of cell A3 and drag down to enter scores 2 through 5 in A4 through A7.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						Write SUM in A9.
					</li>

					<li>
						Enter the counts in B2 through B7.
					</li>

					<li>
						Sum up the counts by writing “=sum(B2:B7)” (without the quotation marks) in B9.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<title>Part 2: Make a bar graph of counts</title>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Highlight the counts (B2 through B7).
					</li>

					<li>
						Under the Insert menu, click “Chart”.
					</li>

					<li>
						It should have the option of a “column chart” selected as default; otherwise select it.
					</li>

					<li>
						On the right side of the screen, in the chart editor, click “add x-axis”.
					</li>

					<li>
						Select A2 to A7 (the values which go in the x-axis) and click ok.
					</li>

					<li>
						Under the “Customize” tab in chart editor, you can change the title and formatting options if you want.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<title>Part 3: Add data for percentages</title>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Compute the percentage for the first value by writing “=100*B2/B9” (without the quotation marks) in C2.
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							We need to apply the same formula several times.
							Here is a way to make that easier.
							<ol>
								<li>
									Attempt to repeat the formula for the other values by dragging C2 down to C7.
								</li>

								<li>
									To see what went wrong, look at the formula that appeared in C3.
									What should the correct formula be?
								</li>

								<li>
									Compute the correct percentages by changing the formula in C2 to “=100*B2/B$9” and repeating part (b).
								</li>

								<li>
									What does the $ do?
								</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						Make column C easier to read by changing the number format.
						Highlight the whole column, then under the Format menu, go to the Number sub-menu (near the top) and select the option <q>Number</q>.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<title>Part 4: Make a bar graph of percentages</title>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Use Ctrl+click to select A2 to A7 and C2 to C7 at the same time.

					<li>
						Repeat Part 2 with the new selection of data.
