		<title>Expected Value</title>
		<p>
			Expected value is perhaps the most useful probability concept we will discuss.
			It has many applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and
			it's one thing that the casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and
			lotteries hope most people never learn about.
		</p>

		<example>
			<p>
				In the casino game roulette, a wheel with 38 spaces (18 red, 18 black, and 2 green)
				is spun.
				In one possible bet, the player bets $1 on a single number.
				If that number is spun on the wheel, then they receive $36 (their original $1 +
				$35).
				Otherwise, they lose their $1.
				On average, how much money should a player expect to win or lose if they play this
				game repeatedly?
			</p>

			<p> Suppose you bet $1 on each of the 38 spaces on the wheel, for a total of $38 bet.
				When the winning number is spun, you are paid $36 on that number. While you won on
				that one number, overall you've lost $2. On a per-space basis, you have “won” <m>
				-\$2/\$38 \approx -\$0.053 </m>. In other words, on average you lose 5.3 cents per
				space you bet on. </p>
		</example>

		<p>
			We call this average gain or loss the expected value of playing roulette.
			Notice that no one ever loses exactly 5.3 cents: most people (in fact, about 37 out of
			every 38) lose $1 and a very few people (about 1 person out of every 38) gain $35 (the
			$36 they win minus the $1 they spent to play the game).
		</p>

		<p> There is another way to compute expected value without imagining what would happen if we
			play every possible space. There are 38 possible outcomes when the wheel spins, so the
			probability of winning is <m>\frac{1}{38}</m>. The complement, the probability of
			losing, is <m>\frac{37}{38}</m>. </p>

		<p>
			Summarizing these along with the values, we get this table:
		</p>

		<sidebyside>
			<tabular top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" halign="center">
				<row bottom="minor">
					<cell>
						Outcome
					</cell>

								\frac{37}{38}
							</me>
						</p>
					</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</sidebyside>

		<p> Notice that if we multiply each outcome by its corresponding probability we get <m>\$35
			\cdot \frac{1}{38} = 0.9211 </m> and <m>-\$1 \cdot \frac{37}{38} = -0.9737</m> , and if
			we add these numbers we get <m>0.9211 + (-0.9737) \approx -0.053</m>, which is the
			expected value we computed above. </p>

		<assemblage>
			<title>Expected Value</title>
			<p>
				<term>Expected value</term> is the average gain or loss of an event if the procedure
				is repeated many times. </p>

			<p>
				We can compute the expected value by multiplying each outcome by the probability of
				that outcome, then adding up the products.
			</p>

			<p>
				You purchase a raffle ticket to help out a charity.
				The raffle ticket costs $5.
				The charity is selling 2000 tickets.
				One of them will be drawn and the person holding the ticket will be given a prize
				worth $4000.
				Compute the expected value for this raffle.
			</p>
		</exploration>

		<example>
			<p>
				In a certain state's lottery, 48 balls numbered 1 through 48 are placed in a machine
				and six of them are drawn at random.
				If the six numbers drawn match the numbers that a player had chosen, the player wins
				$1,000,000.
				If they match 5 numbers, then win $1,000.
				It costs $1 to buy a ticket.
				Find the expected value.
			</p>

			<p> If the probability of matching all 6 numbers is <m>\frac{1}{12271512} \approx
				0.0000000815</m> and the probability of matching 5 numbers is <m>\frac{252}{12271512}
				\approx 0.0000205</m>, our probabilities and outcome values are: </p>

				<tabular top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" halign="center">
					<row bottom="minor">
						<cell>
							Outcome
						</cell>
						<cell>
							Probability of outcome
						</cell>
					</row>
					<row bottom="minor">
						<cell>
							$999,999
						</cell>
						<cell>
							<p>
								<me>
									\frac{1}{12271512}
								</me>
							</p>
						</cell>
					</row>
					<row bottom="minor">
						<cell>
							$999
						</cell>
						<cell>
							<p>
								<me>
									\frac{252}{12271512}

						</cell>
					</row>
					<row bottom="minor">
						<cell>
							-$1
						</cell>
						<cell>
							<p>
								<me>
									1-\frac{253}{12271512} = \frac{12271259}{12271512}
								</me>
							</p>
						</cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>

			<p> The expected value, then is: <me>
					(\$999,999)\cdot \frac{1}{12271512} + (\$999)\cdot \frac{252}{12271512} +
				(-\$1)\cdot \frac{12271259}{12271512} \approx -\$0.898
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				On average, one can expect to lose about 90 cents on a lottery ticket.
				Of course, most players will lose $1.
			</p>
		</example>

		<p> In general, if the expected value of a game is negative, it is not a good idea to play
			the game, since on average you will lose money. It would be better to play a game with a
			positive expected value (good luck trying to find one!), although keep in mind that even
			if the average winnings are positive it could be the case that most people lose money
			and one very fortunate individual wins a great deal of money. If the expected value of a
			game is 0, we call it a <term>fair game</term>, since neither side has an advantage. </p>

		<p>
			Not surprisingly, the expected value for casino games is negative for the player, which
			is positive for the casino.
			It must be positive or they would go out of business.
			Players just need to keep in mind that when they play a game repeatedly, their expected
			value is negative.
			That is fine so long as you enjoy playing the game and think it is worth the cost.
			But it would be wrong to expect to come out ahead.

				A friend offers to play a game, in which you roll 3 standard 6-sided dice.
				If all the dice roll different values, you give him $1.
				If any two dice match values, you get $2.
				What is the expected value of this game? Would you play?
			</p>
		</exploration>

		<p>
			Expected value also has applications outside of gambling.
			Expected value is very common in making insurance decisions.
		</p>

		<example>
			<p> A 40-year-old man in the U.S. has a 0.242%<fn>According to the estimator at
				http://www.numericalexample.com/index.php?view=article\&amp;id=91</fn> risk of dying
				during the next year . An insurance company charges $275 for a life-insurance policy
				that pays a $100,000 death benefit. What is the expected value for the person buying
				the insurance? </p>

				The probabilities and outcomes are

							1-0.00242 = 0.99758
						</cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>

			<p> The expected value is <m>(\$99,275)(0.00242) + (-\$275)(0.99758) = -\$33</m>. </p>
		</example>

		<p>
			Not surprisingly, the expected value is negative; the insurance company can only afford
			to offer policies if they, on average, make money on each policy.
			They can afford to pay out the occasional benefit because they offer enough policies
			that those benefit payouts are balanced by the rest of the insured people.
		</p>

		<p>
			For people buying the insurance, there is a negative expected value, but there is a
			security that comes from insurance that is worth that cost.
