    <title>Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>
        You are probably familiar with the concept of a <term>system of linear equations</term> and with some methods for solving such systems.  
        In this section, we will look at the algebra and geometry of finding and interpreting solutions of systems of linear equations.  
        We will start with two-variable and three-variable systems, then move on to systems involving more variables.

        <p>
            When you were first introduced to systems of equations, you learned to solve for one variable in terms of the other(s), then substitute.  
            Here, we will introduce a systematic method, an algorithm, to solve systems of linear equations.  
            This alternative method, called <term>Gaussian elimination</term>, involves adding multiples of one equation to another equation in order to eliminate one of the variables.  
            This method will form the foundation for an algorithm we will develop for solving linear systems and performing other computations related to systems. 
            Let's explore this in <xref ref="init-systwoeqs1"/>.

                This problem formalizes what you may already know (perhaps under a different name) about <term>elementary row operations</term> as means of solving systems of linear equations.  Consider the system
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    2x\amp   -\amp   y\amp  =\amp  -4\\
                    3x \amp   +\amp   2y\amp  = \amp   1 
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
                We will begin by adding twice the first row to the second row, and replacing the second row with the sum. 
                <me>
                    R_2+2R_1\rightarrow R_2
                </me>
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    2x\amp   -\amp   y\amp  =\amp   -4\\
                    7x \amp   +\amp   0y\amp  = \amp   -7  
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                We choose this row operation because the resulting equation has a zero coefficient for <m>y</m>.  
        
                Next, we make the coefficient of <m>x</m> equal to 1 by multiplying both sides of the second equation by <m>\frac{1}{7}</m>. 
                <me>
                    \frac{1}{7}R_2\rightarrow R_2
                </me>
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    2x\amp   - \amp   y\amp  =\amp  -4\\
                    x \amp   \amp  \amp  = \amp   -1
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                
                We now know <m>x=-1</m>.  Our next goal is to determine <m>y</m> by eliminating <m>x</m> from the first equation.  To this end, we subtract twice the second row from the first row and replace the first row with the difference. 
                <me>
                    R_1-2R_2\rightarrow R_1
                </me>
        
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    0x\amp   -\amp   y\amp  =\amp   -2\\
                    x \amp   \amp  \amp  = \amp  -1 \\
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
        
                Next we multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>-1</m>. 
                <me>
                    -R_1\rightarrow R_1
                </me>
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    \amp    \amp   y\amp  =\amp  2\\
                    x \amp   \amp  \amp  = \amp  -1
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                
                    
                Finally, we can switch the order of equations in order to display <m>x</m> in the top row. 
                <me>
                    R_1\leftrightarrow R_2
                </me>
                
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    x \amp   \amp  \amp  = \amp  -1\\
                    \amp    \amp   y\amp  =\amp  2      
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                
                This solution can be written as an ordered pair <m>(-1, 2)</m>.

            In <xref ref="init-systwoeqs1"/> we introduced elementary row operations and the notation associated with them. We now define these formally.

        As we applied elementary row operations to the system in <xref ref="init-systwoeqs1"/>, the system changed, but you can check that the six systems in the exploration all have the same solution: <m>(-1, 2)</m>.  
        We say two systems are <term>equivalent</term> if they have exactly the same solutions.  So the six systems in <xref ref="init-systwoeqs1"/> are equivalent.
        This property of row operations is so important that we state it formally and outline how to prove it.
        </p>

            
        <theorem xml:id="th-elemRowOpsEquivSys">
            <statement>
                <p>
                For a system of linear equations, performing an elementary row operation gives an equivalent system.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p> 
                Clearly, the order of equations does not affect the solution set, so <xref ref="item-rowswap"/> produces an equivalent system.  Next, you learned years ago that multiplying both sides of an equation by a non-zero constant does not change its solution set, which establishes that <xref ref="item-constantmult"/> produces an equivalent system.  To see that <xref ref="item-addrow"/> produces an equivalent system, note that if we add a multiple of an equation to another equation in the system, we are adding the same thing to both sides, which does not change the solution set of that equation, nor of the system.
                </p>
            </proof>
        </theorem>
        

        <p>
        If a matrix can be obtained from another matrix by means of elementary row operations, we say that the two matrices are <term>row-equivalent</term>.
        <xref ref="th-elemRowOpsEquivSys"/> shows that row-equivalent systems are equivalent.
        It turns out that equivalent systems are not always row-equivalent, but they are row-equivalent if the righthand sides of all the equations are all zeros. 
        Justifying this is <xref ref="prob-equivrowequiv"/> in <xref ref="Section-Row-Echelon-Forms"/>.
        </p>

        <p>    
        The summary of all this discussion is that we can use a sequence of elementary row operations to find, step-by-step, simpler and simpler systems with same solution set.
        Next, we carry out this plan for a larger system of linear equations.

        We will accomplish this by using a convenient variable in one row to ``wipe out" this variable from the other two rows.  For example, we can use <m>x</m> in the third equation to wipe out <m>3x</m> in the first equation and <m>2x</m> in the second equation.  To do this, multiply the third row by <m>-3</m> and add it to the top row, then multiply the third row by <m>-2</m> and add it to the second row.  We now have:
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1-3R_3}\\
         \xrightarrow{R_2-2R_3}\\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp   -\amp  13y\amp  +\amp  7z\amp  = \amp  -33 \\
             0x\amp   -\amp  7y\amp  +\amp  6z\amp  =\amp  -20\\
             x\amp   +\amp  4y\amp  -\amp  2z\amp  =\amp  11
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        In the previous step <m>x</m> was a convenient variable to use because the coefficient in front of <m>x</m> was 1.  We no longer have a variable with coefficient 1.  We could create a coefficient of 1 using division, but that would lead to fractions, making computations cumbersome.  Instead, we will subtract twice the second row from the first row. This gives us:
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1-2R_2}\\
         \\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp  +  \amp   y\amp  -\amp  5z\amp  = \amp  7 \\
             0x\amp   -\amp  7y\amp  +\amp  6z\amp  =\amp  -20\\
             x\amp   +\amp  4y\amp  -\amp  2z\amp  =\amp  11
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        
        Next we add seven times the first row to the second row, and subtract four times the first row from the third row. 
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \\
         \xrightarrow{R_2+7R_1}\\
        \xrightarrow{R_3-4R_1}\\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp   + \amp   y\amp  -\amp  5z\amp  = \amp  7 \\
             0x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  -\amp  29z\amp  =\amp  29\\
             x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  18z\amp  =\amp  -17
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
            
            Now we divide both sides of the second row by <m>-29</m>.
            
            
        <me>
            
            \begin{array}{c}
            \\
         \xrightarrow{-\frac{1}{29}R_2}\\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp   + \amp   y\amp  -\amp  5z\amp  = \amp  7 \\
             0x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  z\amp  =\amp  -1\\
             x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  18z\amp  =\amp  -17
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
            
            Adding <m>5</m> times the second row to the first row and subtracting <m>18</m> times the second row from the third row gives us
            
            
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1+5R_2}\\

         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp   + \amp   y\amp  +\amp  0z\amp  = \amp  2 \\
             0x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  z\amp  =\amp  -1\\
             x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  0z\amp  =\amp  1
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        
        Finally, rearranging the rows gives us
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
             x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  0z\amp  =\amp  1\\
             0x \amp   + \amp   y\amp  +\amp  0z\amp  = \amp  2 \\
             0x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  z\amp  =\amp  -1
             \end{array}
        </me>
        
             
         
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
             x\amp   \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  =\amp  1\\
              \amp    \amp   y\amp  \amp  \amp  = \amp  2 \\
             \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  z\amp  =\amp  -1
             \end{array}
        </me>
            
             
        Thus the system has a unique solution <m>(1, 2, -1)</m>.

        <p>
        At this point you may be wondering whether it will always be possible to take a system of three equations and three unknowns and use elementary row operations to transform it to a system of the form
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              x \amp   \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  = \amp  a \\
             \amp    \amp   y\amp  \amp  \amp  = \amp   b\\
             \amp   \amp  \amp  \amp  z\amp  =\amp  c
            \end{array}
        </me>
        The short answer to this question is NO.  The existence of an equivalent system of this form implies that the original system has exactly one solution, namely <m>(a, b, c)</m>.  However, it is possible for a system to have no solutions or to have infinitely many solutions.  We will study these different possibilities from an algebraic perspective in subsequent sections.  For now, we will attempt to gain insight into existence and uniqueness of solutions through geometry.

            It is time consuming to rewrite each equation, with all variable names and plus signs, after each row operation. 
            So let's find a more efficient method for performing elementary row operations. 
        </p>

        <p>

                        The linear system in this Exploration comes from Jim Hefferon's <url href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/#current_version">Linear Algebra</url>.

            Our goal is to use elementary row operations to transform this system into an equivalent system of the form
            <me>\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
                  x \amp  \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp \amp = \amp a \\
                 \amp  \amp y\amp \amp \amp \amp \amp =\amp b\\
                 \amp  \amp \amp \amp z\amp \amp \amp =\amp c\\

                \end{array}
                </me>
             We have to keep in mind that given an arbitrary system, an equivalent system of this form may not exist (we will talk a lot more about this later).  However, it does exist in this case, and we would like to find a more efficient way of getting to it than having to write and rewrite our equations at each step.

            Observe that throughout the entire process, variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> remained in place; only the coefficients in front of the variables and the entries on the right changed.  Let's try to recreate this process without writing down the variables.  We can capture the original system in <xref ref="eq-sys20originalsystem1"/> as follows:

               The side to the left of the vertical bar is called the <term>coefficient matrix</term>, while the side to the right of the bar is a vector that consists of constants on the right side of the system.  
               The coefficient matrix, together with the vector, is called an <term>augmented matrix</term>.

            While the augmented matrix in <xref ref="eq-sys20reducedrowechelon"/> was certainly ``convenient", we could have converted back to the equation format a little earlier.  Let's take a look at the augmented matrix in <xref ref="eq-sys20rowechelon"/>.  Converting <xref ref="eq-sys20rowechelon"/> to a system of equations gives us

              Now substituting <m>x_3=2</m> and <m>x_2=-\frac{13}{2}</m> into the first equation results in

                x_1=1+\left(-\frac{13}{2}\right)+3(2)=\frac{1}{2}

            Observe that the coefficient matrices in <xref ref="eq-sys20rref"/> and <xref ref="eq-sys20reducedrowechelon"/> have the same format: 1's along the diagonal, zeros above and below the 1's.  The other ``convenient" format, exhibited by the coefficient matrix in <xref ref="eq-sys20rowechelon"/>,  also has zeros below the diagonal, but not all of the diagonal entries are 1's and some of the entries above the diagonal are not zero.  Each of these formats gives rise to a definition.  These definitions are the topic of the next section.

            Unlike the situation in <xref ref="ex-systwoeqs2"/>, any combination of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> satisfies the second equation.  So, any ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m> that satisfies the first equation will satisfy the second equation.  Thus, the solution set for this system is the same as the set of all solutions of <m>4x+3y=2</m>.

            We found that the system has a unique solution <m>(1, 2, -1)</m>.  The graph of each equation is a plane.  The three planes intersect at a single point, as shown in the figure.

            Given a linear system of three equations in three variables, there are three ways in which the system can be consistent.
            <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    First, the three planes could intersect at a single point, giving us a unique solution.

                    Second, the three planes can intersect in a line, forming a paddle-wheel shape.  In this case, every point along the line of intersection is a solution to the system, giving us infinitely many solutions.

        <title>General Systems of Linear Equations</title>

        <p> 
        Here we collect together all of the definitions from this section, written as generally as possible.

        A <term>linear equation</term> in variables <m>x_1, \ldots, x_n</m> is an equation that can be written in the form
        
        <me>
            a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\ldots +a_nx_n=b
        </me>
        
        where <m>a_1,\ldots ,a_n</m> and <m>b</m> are constants.
        We call <m>a_i</m> the <term>coefficient</term> of <m>x_i</m> in the equation, and we call <m>b</m> the <term>constant term</term>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>
            An <m>n</m>-tuple of numbers
            <me>
            (z_1, z_2,\ldots ,z_n)
            </me>

            is a <term>solution</term> to the equation <m>a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\ldots +a_nx_n=b</m> provided that, when we set <m>x_1</m> equal to <m>z_1</m> and so on, the equation becomes a true statement.
        </p>
        <p>
        The set of all <m>n</m>-tuples that are solutions to a given equation is called the <term>graph</term> of the equation. The graph of a linear equation in two variables is a line in <m>\R^2</m>.  The graph of a linear equation in three variables is a plane in <m>\R^3</m>.  In <m>\R^n</m>, for <m>n\gt3</m>, we say that the graph of a linear equation is a <term>hyperplane</term>. A hyperplane cannot be visualized, but we can still talk about intersections of hyperplanes and their other attributes in algebraic terms.  
        </p>
            
            <p>
            A linear system of <m>m</m> equations and <m>n</m> unknowns is typically written as follows

                \begin{array}{ccccccccc}

            <p>
            A <term>solution to a system</term> of linear equations in <m>n</m> variables is an <m>n</m>-tuple that satisfies every equation in  the system.  All solutions to a system of equations, taken together, form its <term>solution set</term>.
            We say that a system of equations is <term>consistent</term> if it has at least one solution, and <term>inconsistent</term> if it has no solutions.  If a system is consistent, we say that it has a <term>unique solution</term> if there is exactly one solution, or <term>infinitely many solutions</term> if there are infinitely many solutions.

                We will sometimes use the following notation to represent an augmented matrix.

            The same elementary row operations that we perform on a system of equations can be performed on the corresponding augmented matrix, or any matrix for that matter.
