    <title>Introduction to Vector Spaces</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>
        There are two operations on vectors in <m>\R^n</m>, namely, vector addition and scalar multiplication. 
        We learned that addition and scalar multiplication satisfy a number of nice properties (see <xref ref="th-vecproperties"/>). 
        These properties give <m>\R^n</m> an algebraic structure.  
    </p>

    <p>
        We begin this section by introducing another property, called <term>closure</term>.  
        Adding closure to the properties we studied earlier allows us to show that <m>\R^n</m> satisfies all of the properties of a <term>vector space</term>, which we will formally define in this section.  
    </p>
    </introduction>

        <p> 
        Here are a few examples and non-examples to understand these properties. 
        </p>

        <example xml:id="ex-posevenint">
            <p>
                Let <m>E</m> be the set of positive even integers.  Then <m>E</m> is closed under addition, because the sum of two even integers is again an even integer.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example xml:id="ex-posoddint">
            <p>
                Let <m>D</m> be the set of positive odd integers.  Then <m>D</m> is not closed under addition, for the sum of two odd integers need not be an odd integer (in fact, it will always be even).
            </p>
        </example>

        <example xml:id="Q1">
            <statement>
                <p>
        Let <m>X_1</m> be defined as the set of vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> in the first quadrant (or on an axis on the boundary of the first quadrant). Written in symbols:

        <me>
            X_1=\left\{\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x_1 \ge 0, \ x_2 \ge 0 \right\}
        </me>

        Show that <m>X_1</m> is closed under addition, but <m>X_1</m> is not closed under scalar multiplication.
            </p>
            </statement>


            <answer>
                <p>
                    Suppose <m>\mathbf{v}_1=[a,b]</m> and <m>\mathbf{v}_2=[c,d]</m> are in <m>X_1</m>.  This means that <m>a, b, c, d\geq 0</m>.  But then we have <m>a+c, b+d\geq 0</m>.  Therefore
                    <me>
                    \mathbf{v}_1+\mathbf{v}_2=\begin{bmatrix}a+c\\b+d\end{bmatrix}
                    </me>
                is also in <m>X_1</m>. We conclude that <m>X_1</m> is closed under addition. <m>X_1</m> is not closed under scalar multiplication because
                <me>
                    (-1)\mathbf{v}_1=\begin{bmatrix}-a\\-b\end{bmatrix}
                </me>
                is not in <m>X_1</m>.The figure below helps us see that the sum of any two vectors in <m>X_1</m> also lies in <m>X_1</m>.

    <remark>
        <statement>
            <p>
                All scalars in this text are assumed to be real numbers.  
                Considering other scalars, such as complex numbers, is interesting and leads to the definition of <em>complex vector spaces</em>.
                We will not discuss complex vector spaces in this text, but you may encounter them in a future course or your professional career.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </remark>

    <p>
        In the next two examples we will explore two sets other than <m>\R^n</m> endowed with vector addition and scalar multiplication and satisfying the same properties.
    </p> 


    <example xml:id="ex-setofmatricesvectorspace">
        <p>
            Let <m>\mathbb{M}_{m,n}</m> be the set of all <m>m\times n</m> matrices.  Matrix addition and scalar multiplication were defined in <xref ref="Section-Matrix-Operations"/>.
            Observe that the sum of two <m>m\times n</m> matrices is also an <m>m\times n</m> matrix. Likewise, a scalar multiple of an <m>m\times n</m> matrix is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix.  Thus 
    <ul>
        <li>
        <p> <m>\mathbb{M}_{m,n}</m> is closed under matrix addition; </p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <p> <m>\mathbb{M}_{m,n}</m> is closed under scalar multiplication. </p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    Next, <xref ref="th-propertiesofaddition"/> and <xref ref="th-propertiesscalarmult"/> give us the following properties of matrix addition and scalar multiplication.  Note that these properties are analogous to the eight vector properties above.
    <ol>
    <li>
        <p> Commutative Property of Addition:  <m>\quad A+B=B+A</m>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Associative Property of Addition: <m>\quad (A+B)+C=A+(B+C)</m>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Existence of Additive Identity:  <m>\quad A+O=A \ </m> where <m>O</m> is the <m>m \times n</m> zero matrix. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Existence of Additive Inverse:  <m>\quad A+(-A)=O</m>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Distributive Property over Matrix Addition:  <m>\quad k(A+B)=kA+kB</m>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Distributive Property over Scalar Addition:  <m>\quad (k+p)A=kA+pA</m>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Associative Property for Scalar Multiplication: <m>\quad k(pA)=(kp)A</m>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Multiplication by <m>1</m>: <m>\quad 1A=A</m>. </p>
    </li>
    </ol>
        Because <m>\mathbb{M}_{m,n}</m> with these two operations satisfies all of these properties, it is a vector space.
        </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-linfunctionsvectspace">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the set <m>\mathbb{L}</m> of all linear functions.  This set includes all polynomials of degree <m>1</m> and degree <m>0</m>.  We will use addition and scalar multiplication of polynomials as the two operations, and show that <m>\mathbb{L}</m> is closed under those operations and satisfies eight properties analogous to those of vectors of <m>\R^n</m>.
        </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                Elements of <m>\mathbb{L}</m> are functions <m>f</m> given by

    <me>
        f(x)=mx+b.
    </me>

    (Note that either <m>m</m> or <m>b</m> or both can be equal to zero.)
    </p> 

    <p>
    Given <m>f_1</m> and <m>f_2</m> in <m>\mathbb{L}</m>, it is easy to verify that <m>f_1+f_2</m> is also in <m>\mathbb{L}</m>.  This gives us closure under function addition.

    For any scalar <m>k</m>, we have

    <me>
        kf(x)=k(mx+b)=(km)x+(kb).
    </me>

    Therefore <m>kf</m> is in <m>\mathbb{L}</m>, and <m>\mathbb{L}</m> is closed under scalar multiplication.

    We now proceed to formulate eight properties analogous to those of vectors of <m>\R^n</m>.

    <p>
    When scalars <m>k</m> and <m>p</m> in the above definition are required to be real numbers, as they usually are in this text, the vector space <m>V</m> may be called a <term>real vector space</term> or
    <term>vector space over the real numbers</term>.
    In <xref ref="Chapter-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors"/>, we will sometimes consider complex numbers and that means that our typical vector space will be <m>\mathbb{C}^n</m> and our scalars will be complex numbers;
    no change in the definition above is needed, other than allowing scalars to be complex numbers, for a <term>vector space over the complex numbers</term>.
    </p> 

    <p>
    We have already encountered two real vectors spaces in <xref ref="ex-setofmatricesvectorspace"/> and <xref ref="ex-linfunctionsvectspace"/>, 
    namely <m>\mathbb{M}_{m,n}</m> and <m>\mathbb{L}</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Sets of polynomials provide an important source of examples, so we review some basic facts. A <term>polynomial with real coefficients</term> in <m>x</m> is an expression
    <me>
    p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_nx^n
    </me>
    where <m>a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}</m> are real numbers called the <term>coefficients</term> of the polynomial. 
    </p>

    <p>
    If all the coefficients are zero, the polynomial is called the <term>zero polynomial</term> and is denoted simply as <m>0</m>. 
    </p> 

    <p> 
    If <m>p(x) \neq 0</m>, the highest power of <m>x</m> with a nonzero coefficient is called the <term>degree</term> of <m>p(x)</m> and denoted as <m>\mbox{deg}(p(x))</m>. The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined.
    The coefficient of this highest power of <m>x</m> is called the <term>leading coefficient</term> of <m>p(x)</m>. 
    Hence <m>\mbox{deg}(3 + 5x) = 1</m> and its leading coefficient is <m>5</m>, <m>\mbox{deg}(1 + 3x - x^{2}) = 2</m> and its leading coefficient is <m>-1</m>, and the constant polynomial <m>p(x)=4</m> had degree 0 and leading coefficient 4. 
    </p> 

    <p>
    To simplify our calculations, for the polynomial <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n</m>, we define <m>a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots</m> to all be zero.
    This means <m>a_i</m> will make sense for all non-negative values of <m>i</m>.
    For example, <m>p(x)</m> is the zero polynomial exactly when <m>a_i=0</m> for all non-negative integers <m>i</m>.
    Because <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial, there are only finitely many <m>i</m> with <m>a_i \neq 0</m> and, when <m>p(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial, the largest such index <m>i</m> is the degree of <m>p(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let <m>\mathbb{P}</m> denote the set of all polynomials and suppose that
    <md>
    <mrow> p(x) \amp = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_mx^m</mrow>
    <mrow> q(x) \amp = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \cdots + b_nx^n</mrow>
    </md>
    are two polynomials in <m>\mathbb{P}</m> (possibly of different degrees). Then <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> are called <term>equal</term> (written <m>p(x) = q(x)</m>) if and only if all the corresponding coefficients are equal---
    that is, one has <m>a_{0} = b_{0}</m>, <m>a_{1} = b_{1}</m>, <m>a_{2} = b_{2}</m>, and so on. 
    In particular, <m>a_{0} + a_{1}x + \ldots + a_mx^m = 0</m> means <m>a_{0} = 0</m>, <m>a_{1} = 0</m>, <m>a_{2} = 0</m>, <m>\ldots</m>. 
    </p> 

    <p>
    The set <m>\mathbb{P}</m> has vector addition and scalar multiplication operations defined as follows: if <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> are as before and <m>k</m> is a real number,
    <md>
    <mrow> p(x) + q(x) \amp = (a_0 + b_0) + (a_1 + b_1)x + (a_2 + b_2)x^2 + \cdots + (a_j+b_j) x^j</mrow>
    <mrow> kp(x) \amp = ka_0 + (ka_1)x + (ka_2)x^2 + \cdots + (k a_m) x^m </mrow>
    </md> 
    where <m>j</m> is the larger of <m>m</m> or <m>n</m>.  
    Notice that the degree of <m>p(x)+q(x)</m> is at most the larger of the degrees of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> and
    the degree of <m>k(p(x))</m> is exactly the degree of <m>p(x)</m>, provided <m>k \ne 0</m>.

    <p> 
    This is a ton of terminology, so we need some examples to understand it. 
    </p>

        <answer>
            <p>
                It is easy to see that the sum of two polynomials is again a polynomial, and that a scalar multiple of a polynomial is a polynomial.  Thus, <m>\mathbb{P}</m> is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.  The other eight vector space properties can be verified (do one yourself), and we conclude that <m>\mathbb{P}</m> is a vector space.

        <answer>
            <p>
            Observe that <m>Y</m> is not closed under addition.  To see this, let <m>y_1 = 2x^2+3x+4</m> and let <m>y_2=-2x^2</m>.  Then <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are both elements of <m>Y</m>.  However, <m>y_1+y_2 = 3x+4</m> is not an element of <m>Y</m>, as it is only a degree one polynomial.  We require the coefficient <m>a</m> of <m>x^2</m> to be nonzero for a polynomial to be in <m>Y</m>, and this is not the case for <m>y_1+y_2</m>.

    <p>
    The set <m>Y</m> in <xref ref="ex-deg2onlynotavecspace"/> is not a vector space, but if we make a slight modification, we can make it into a vector space.

    An example to showcase this is in order.

    <example xml:id="ex-subspaceabstract1">
    <p>
    In <xref ref="ex-deg-le-2vectorspace"/> we demonstrated that <m>\mathbb{P}^2</m> is a vector space.  From <xref ref="ex-pisavectorspace"/> we know that <m>\mathbb{P}</m> is a vector space. But <m>\mathbb{P}^2</m> is a subset of <m>\mathbb{P}</m>, and uses the same operations of polynomial addition and scalar multiplication.  Therefore <m>\mathbb{P}^2</m> is a subspace of <m>\mathbb{P}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Checking all ten properties to verify that a subset of a vector space is a subspace can be cumbersome.  Fortunately we have the following theorem.
    </p> 

    <theorem xml:id="th-subspacetestabstract">
        <title>Subspace Test</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>U</m> be a nonempty subset of a vector space <m>V</m>.  If <m>U</m> is closed under the operations of addition and scalar multiplication of <m>V</m>, then <m>U</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>

    <proof>
        <p>
    To prove that closure is a sufficient condition for <m>U</m> to be a subspace, we will need to show that closure under addition and scalar multiplication of <m>V</m> guarantees that the remaining eight properties are satisfied automatically.  
        </p>

        <p>
    Observe that <xref ref="item-commaddvectspdef"/>, <xref ref="item-assaddvectspdef"/>, <xref ref="item-distvectaddvectspdef"/>, <xref ref="item-distscalaraddvectspdef"/>, <xref ref="item-assmultvectspdef"/> and <xref ref="item-idmultvectspdef"/> hold for all elements of <m>V</m>.  Thus, these properties will hold for all elements of <m>U</m>.  We say that these properties are <term>inherited</term> from <m>V</m>.

        <p>
    To prove <xref ref="item-idaddvectspdef"/> we need to show that <m>\mathbf{0}</m>, which we know to be an element of <m>V</m>, is contained in <m>U</m>.  Let <m>\mathbf{u}</m> be an element of <m>U</m> (recall that <m>U</m> is nonempty).  We will show that <m>0\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}</m> in <m>V</m>.  Then, by closure under scalar multiplication, we will be able to conclude that <m>0\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}</m> must be in <m>U</m>.

    <me>
        0\mathbf{u}=(0+0)\mathbf{u}=0\mathbf{u}+0\mathbf{u}.
    </me>

    Adding the additive inverse of <m>0\mathbf{u}</m> to both sides gives us

    <me>
        0\mathbf{u}+(-0\mathbf{u})=(0\mathbf{u}+0\mathbf{u})+(-0\mathbf{u}).
    </me>

    Thanks to <xref ref="item-assaddvectspdef"/> and <xref ref="item-invaddvectspdef"/>.


    <me>
        \mathbf{0}=0\mathbf{u}+(0\mathbf{u}+(-0\mathbf{u})).
    </me>

    By <xref ref="item-idaddvectspdef"/> and <xref ref="item-invaddvectspdef"/>

    <me>
        \mathbf{0}=0\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{0}=0\mathbf{u}.
    </me>


    Because <m>U</m> is closed under scalar multiplication <m>0\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}</m> is in <m>U</m>.

    We know that every element of <m>U</m>, being an element of <m>V</m>, has an additive inverse  in <m>V</m>.  We need to show that the additive inverse of every element of <m>U</m> is contained in <m>U</m>. Let <m>\mathbf{u}</m> be any element of <m>U</m>.  We will show that <m>(-1)\mathbf{u}</m> is the additive inverse of <m>\mathbf{u}</m>.  Then by closure, <m>(-1)\mathbf{u}</m> will have to be contained in <m>U</m>.  To show that <m>(-1)\mathbf{u}</m> is the additive inverse of <m>\mathbf{u}</m>, we must show that <m>\mathbf{u}+(-1)\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}</m>.  We compute:

    <me>
        \mathbf{u}+(-1)\mathbf{u}=1\mathbf{u}+(-1)\mathbf{u}=(1+(-1))\mathbf{u}=0\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}.
    </me>

    Thus <m>(-1)\mathbf{u}</m> is the additive inverse of <m>\mathbf{u}</m>. By closure, <m>(-1)\mathbf{u}</m> is in <m>U</m>.

    <answer>
    <p>
    The set <m>C_A</m> consists of all <m>n\times n</m> matrices <m>X</m> such that <m>AX=XA</m>.  First, observe that <m>C_A</m> is not empty because <m>I_n</m> is an element.  Now we need to show that <m>C_A</m> is closed under matrix addition and scalar multiplication.

    Suppose that <m>X_1</m> and <m>X_{2}</m> lie in <m>C_A</m>.  Then <m>AX_1 = X_1A</m> and <m>AX_{2} = X_{2}A</m>. Then

    A(X_1 + X_2) 	= AX_1 + AX_2 = X_1A + X_2A + (X_1 + X_2)A.

    A(kX)= k(AX) = k(XA) = (kX)A.

    Therefore <m>(kX)</m> commutes with <m>A</m>.  We conclude that <m>(kX)</m> is in <m>C_A</m>, and <m>C_A</m> is closed under scalar multiplication.

            </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
            <p> 
               Since a subspace is nonempty, there is some vector <m>\mathbf{w}</m> in <m>W</m>. Then <m>0 \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}</m> is in <m>W</m> because <m>W</m> is closed under scalar multiplication.

    <p>
        Consider lines in <m>\R^n</m>. Applying <xref ref="th-zero-in-subspace"/> shows that the only lines in <m>\R^n</m> that are subspaces are those that pass through the origin. 
        The same holds true for planes and hyperplanes.  
        For example, the plane <m>z=3</m> in <m>\R^3</m> is not a subspace of <m>\R^3</m>. It turns out that any plane containing the origin is a subspace.
    </p>

    <p>
        Be warned that containing the zero vector is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition to be a subspace.
        That is, if a subset does not contain the zero vector, then it is not a subspace.  But if a subset does contain the zero vector, it may or may not be a subspace.
        For example, the subset of <m>\R^2</m> given by <m>\{ (x,y) : y=x^2 \}</m>, the graph of the parabola <m>y=x^2</m>, contains the zero vector of <m>\R^2</m>, but is not a subspace since it is not closed under addition.

    We revisit the situation for some specific polynomials.

    <example xml:id="ex-inthespanpoly">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider <m>p_{1} = 1 + x + 4x^{2}</m> and <m>p_{2} = 1 + 5x + x^{2}</m> in <m>\mathbb{P}^{2}</m>. 
                Determine whether <m>p_{1}</m> and <m>p_{2}</m> lie in 
                <me>
                    \mbox{span}\{1 + 2x - x^{2}, 3 + 5x + 2x^{2}\}.
                </me>
        </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                For <m>p_{1}</m>, we want to determine if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> exist such that
    <me>
    p_1 = a(1 + 2x - x^2) + b(3 + 5x + 2x^2).
    </me>

    Expanding the right hand side gives us:

    <me>
        a+2ax-ax^2+3b+5bx+2bx^2.
    </me>

    Combining like terms, we get:

    <me>
        (a+3b)+(2a+5b)x+(-a+2b)x^2.
    </me>

    Setting this equal to <m>p_{1} = 1 + x + 4x^{2}</m> and
    equating coefficients of powers of <m>x</m> gives us a system of equations
    <me>
    1 = a + 3b,\quad 1 = 2a + 5b, \quad \mbox{ and } \quad 4 = -a + 2b.
    </me>
    This system has the solution <m>a = -2</m> and <m>b = 1</m>, so <m>p_{1}</m> is indeed in <m>\mbox{span}\{1 + 2x - x^{2}, 3 + 5x + 2x^{2}\}</m>.

    Turning to <m>p_{2} = 1 + 5x + x^{2}</m>, we are looking for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that 
    <me>
    p_{2} = a(1 + 2x - x^{2}) + b(3 + 5x + 2x^{2}).
    </me>
    Again equating coefficients of powers of <m>x</m> gives equations <m>1 = a + 3b</m>, <m>5 = 2a + 5b</m>, and <m>1 = -a + 2b</m>. But in this case there is no solution, so <m>p_{2}</m> is not in <m>\mbox{span}\{1 + 2x - x^{2}, 3 + 5x + 2x^{2}\}</m>.

    <theorem xml:id="th-span-is-subspace">

        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>V</m> be a vector space.  Let <m>S</m> be any subset of <m>V</m>.  Then <m>U=\mbox{span}(S)</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>

    <proof>
        <p>
            We leave this an exercise for the reader, namely <xref ref="prob-spanisasubspaceabstract"/>.
        </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
        This theorem is used often, as it gives a quick way to show a subset of a vector space is a subspace.  
        If we can show the subset is the span of some set of vectors, then we know the subset is a subspace without further calculation.
        Going back to Example <xref ref="ex-deg-le-2vectorspace"/>, a quick way to show <m>\mathbb{P}^2</m> is a subspace of <m>\mathbb{P}</m> is by observing that <m>\mathbb{P}^2=\mbox{span}(1,x,x^2)</m>.
    </p>
    
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Verify that every line, plane, and hyperplane through the origin in <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                This is a direct consequence of <xref ref="th-span-is-subspace"/>.  
                For example, consider the line through the origin in <m>\R^3</m> spanned by the vector <m>\mathbf{v} = [1,2,3]</m>.  
                The span of this vector is the set of all scalar multiples of <m>\mathbf{v}</m>, which is a subspace of <m>\R^3</m>.  
                Similarly, any plane or hyperplane through the origin can be expressed as the span of two or more vectors, respectively, and thus is also a subspace.

                    In this problem we will check that the set <m>\mathbb{C}</m> of all complex numbers is in fact a real vector space.  Let <m>z_1 = a_1 + b_1 i</m> be a complex number.  Similarly, let <m>z_2 = a_2 + b_2 i</m>, <m>z_3 = a_3 + b_3 i</m> be complex numbers, and let <m>k</m> and <m>p</m> be real number scalars.  Check that complex numbers are closed under addition and multiplication, and that they satisfy each of the vector space properties.
