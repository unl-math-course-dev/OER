<p>Since \(h\) is always decreasing for \(x \lt a\text{,}\) always increasing for \(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\) and always decreasing for \(x \gt b\text{,}\) we know that \(h\) has a local minimum at \(x = a\) and a local maximum at \(x = b\text{.}\) Moreover, these local extremes are both global extremes since \(h(x) to 0\) as \(x \to \pm \infty\text{.}\) In particular, since \(h(x)\) decreases to \(0\) for \(x \gt b\) and increases on \(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\) it follows that \(h(b)\) is the largest value of \(h(x)\) on \((a, \infty)\text{,}\) and that \(h(b) \gt 0\text{.}\) Similarly, since \(h(x)\) decreases on \((-\infty,
a)\) and approaches \(0\) as \(x \to -\infty\text{,}\) and \(h(x)\) increases on \(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\) it must be the case that \(h(a)\) is the least value of \(h(x)\) on \((-\infty,
b)\) and that \(h(b) \lt 0\text{.}\) Hence, \(h(x)\) is always negative on \(x \lt a\) and \(h(x)\) is always positive on \(x \gt b\text{.}\) From all of these observations, it follows that \(h\) has a global minimum at \(x = a\) and a global maximum at \(x = b\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-3-optimization.html#li-2050">in-context</a></span>
