<p>The farmer will fence a rectangular area whose length \(x\) and width \(y\) are unknown. The total area of the rectangular area is composed of 4 equal area rectangles. There are two ways to do this as shown in the figure below.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/3_4_Ez2Soln.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>We want to maximize the area of each subrectangular region, which is the same as maximizing the total area \(A = xy\) of the entire rectangular region. Since \(A\) has two variables, we can't yet directly apply calculus techniques to it. We use the information about the amount of fencing to relate \(x\) and \(y\) in order to write \(A\) in terms of just one variable.</p>
<p>In the case of the fencing option on the left in the figure, the total amount of fencing that is needed to enclose the four grazing areas is \(2x+5y\text{.}\) We assume that all of the \(7500\) feet of fencing will be used, so \(2x+5y=7500\text{.}\) Solving for \(x\text{,}\) \(x = 3750 - 2.5y\text{.}\) Substituting this expression for \(x\) into the area formula allows us to write \(A\) in terms of \(y\) alone:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A(y) = (3750-2.5y)y = 3750y - 2.5y^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To enclose any area, we of course must have \(y \gt 0\) and \(x \gt 0\text{,}\) and since \(x = 3750 - 2.5y\text{,}\) it follows that we need to have \(2.5y \lt 3750\) so \(y \lt 1500\text{.}\) To find the maximum value of \(A\) on this domain, we find the critical numbers of \(A\text{.}\) Since \(A'(y) = 3750 - 5y\text{,}\) we see that \(A'(y) = 0\) when and only when \(y = 750\text{.}\) For \(0 \lt y \lt 750\text{,}\) we see that \(A'(y) \gt 0\) and for \(750 \lt y \lt 1500\) we have \(A'(y) \lt 0\text{.}\) So \(A(750) = 1406250\) square feet is the absolute maximum value of \(A\text{.}\) The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is one quarter of the total, or \(351562.5\) square feet.</p>
<p>In the case of the fencing option on the right in the figure, the total amount of fencing that is needed to enclose the four grazing areas is \(3x+3y\text{.}\) We assume that all of the \(7500\) feet of fencing will be used, so \(3x + 3y = 7500\text{.}\) Solving for \(x\) and substituting into \(A\text{,}\) we find \(x = 2500 - y\) and</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A(y) = (2500-y)y = 2500y - y^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To enclose any area, we of course must have \(y \gt 0\) and \(x \gt 0\text{,}\) and since \(x = 2500 - y\text{,}\) it follows that we need to have \(y \lt 2500\text{.}\) To find the maximum value of \(A\) on this domain, we find the critical numbers of \(A\text{.}\) Since \(A'(y) = 2500 - 2y\text{,}\) we see that \(A'(y) = 0\) when and only when \(y = 1250\text{.}\) For \(0 \lt y \lt 1250\text{,}\) we see that \(A'(y) \gt 0\) and for \(1250 \lt y \lt 2500\) we have \(A'(y) \lt 0\text{.}\) So \(A(1250) = 1406250\) square feet is the absolute maximum value of \(A\text{.}\) The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is one quarter of the total, or \(390625\) square feet.</p>
<p>So the maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is 390625 square feet.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-4-applied-opt.html#solution-148">in-context</a></span>
