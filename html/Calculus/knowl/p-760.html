<p>When a function is increasing, its graph rises as \(x\) increases, and when a function is concave up, that means the graph of the function looks bowl-shaped. A graph of an increasing, concave up function \(f\) on the interval \((-3,0)\) is shown in the following figure. When a function is concave down, its graph looks like an upside down bowl. The function \(f\) in the figure is increasing and concave down on the interval \((0,3)\) Note that \(f\) is also increasing on the entire interval \((-3,3)\text{.}\)</p>

<p>When a function is increasing, its graph rises as \(x\)increases, and when a function is concave down, that means the graph of the function looks like an upside down bowl. A graph of an increasing, concave down function \(g\) on the interval \((-3,0)\) is shown in the figure below. When a function is concave up, its graph looks like a bowl. The function \(g\) in the figure is increasing and concave up on the interval \((0,3)\text{.}\) Note that \(g\) is also increasing on the entire interval \((-3,3)\text{.}\)</p>

<p>When a function is decreasing, its graph falls as \(x\) increases, and when a function is concave up, that means the graph of the function looks bowl-shaped. A graph of a decreasing, concave up function \(h\) on the interval \((-3,-1)\)is shown in the figure below. To be neither concave up or concave down, a graph has to be linear, so the graph of \(h\) in the following figure is a straight line on \((-1,1)\text{.}\) When a function is concave down, its graph looks like an upside down bowl. The function \(h\) in the figure is decreasing and concave down on the interval \((1,3)\text{.}\) Note that \(h\) is decreasing on the entire interval \((-3,3)\text{.}\)</p>

<p>When a function is decreasing, its graph falls as \(x\) increases, and when a function is concave down, that means the graph of the function looks like an upside down bowl. A graph of a decreasing, concave down function \(p\) on the interval \((-3,0)\) is shown in the figure below. When a function is increasing, its graph rises as \(x\) increases. The function \(p\) in the figure is increasing and concave down on the interval \((0,3)\text{.}\)</p>
