<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The critical numbers of a continuous function \(f\) are the values of \(p\) for which \(f'(p) = 0\) or \(f'(p)\) does not exist. These values are important because they identify horizontal tangent lines or corner points on the graph, which are the only possible locations at which a local maximum or local minimum can occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a differentiable function \(f\text{,}\) whenever \(f'\) is positive, \(f\) is increasing; whenever \(f'\) is negative, \(f\) is decreasing. The first derivative test tells us that at any point where \(f\) changes from increasing to decreasing, \(f\) has a local maximum, while conversely at any point where \(f\) changes from decreasing to increasing \(f\) has a local minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a twice differentiable function \(f\text{,}\) if we have a horizontal tangent line at \(x = p\) and \(f''(p)\) is nonzero, the sign of \(f''\) tells us the concavity of \(f\)and hence whether \(f\) has a maximum or minimum at \(x = p\text{.}\) In particular, if \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) \lt 0\text{,}\) then \(f\) is concave down at \(p\) and \(f\) has a local maximum there, while if \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) \gt 0\text{,}\) then \(f\) has a local minimum at \(p\text{.}\) If \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) = 0\text{,}\) then the second derivative does not tell us whether \(f\) has a local extreme at \(p\) or not.</p></li>
