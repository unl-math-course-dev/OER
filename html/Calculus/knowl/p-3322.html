<p>Thus, the biker traveled \(11\) miles north from their starting point (mile \(1\)) and thus made the turn at \(t = 1\) at mile \(12\text{.}\) Two hours later, having pedaled south at \(10\) mph, they'd traveled \(20\) miles south, and thus were at mile \(12 - 20 = -8\) relative to Pigeon Lake. Finally, after biking at \(9\) mph north for the lat hour, they were back at mile \(-8 + 9 = 1\text{.}\)</p>
