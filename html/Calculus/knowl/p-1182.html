<p>In words, the Sum Rule tells us that “the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.” It also tells us that a sum of two differentiable functions is also differentiable. Furthermore, because we can view the difference function \(y = (f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)\) as \(y = f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))\text{,}\) the Sum Rule and Constant Multiple Rules together tell us that \(\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))] = f'(x) - g'(x)\text{,}\) or that “the derivative of a difference is the difference of the derivatives.” We can now compute derivatives of sums and differences of elementary functions.</p>
