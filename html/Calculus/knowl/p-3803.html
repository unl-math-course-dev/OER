<p>The general problem of finding an antiderivative is difficult. In part, this is due to the fact that we are trying to undo the process of differentiating, and the undoing is much more difficult than the doing. For example, while it is evident that an antiderivative of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) is \(F(x) = -\cos(x)\) and that an antiderivative of \(g(x) = x^2\) is \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3\text{,}\) combinations of \(f\) and \(g\) can be far more complicated. Consider the functions</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
5\sin(x) - 4x^2, \ x^2 \sin(x), \ \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2}, \ \text{and}  \ \sin(x^2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
