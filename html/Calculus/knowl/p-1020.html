<p>See the plot in the image below, which shows, at left, a possible graph of \(y = f(x)\) near \(x = 2\text{,}\) along with the tangent line \(y = L(x)\) through \((2, f(2))\text{.}\) Note that \(y = f(x)\) is concave up for \(x \lt 2\) since \(f'\) is increasing on that interval, and \(y = f(x)\) is concave down for \(x &gt; 2\) since \(f'\) is decreasing there. Hence \(y = f(x)\) changes from concave up to concave down right at \(x = 2\text{,}\) which is also the point near 2 where the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is steepest.</p>
