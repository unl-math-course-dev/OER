<p>Since we know \(f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2\text{,}\) we can find the critical numbers of \(f\) by solving \(3x^4 - 9x^2 = 0\text{.}\) Factoring, we observe that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
0 = 3x^2(x^2 - 3) = 3x^2(x+\sqrt{3})(x-\sqrt{3})\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so that \(x = 0, \pm\sqrt{3}\) are the three critical numbers of \(f\text{.}\) The first derivative sign chart for \(f\) is given in <a knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-signchart2.html" knowl-id="xref-F-3-1-signchart2" alt="Figure 3.11 " title="Figure 3.11 ">Figure 3.11</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/3_1_signchart2.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">3.11</span>The first derivative sign chart for \(f\) when \(f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2 = 3x^2(x^2-3)\text{.}\)</figcaption></figure><p>We see that \(f\) is increasing on the intervals \((-\infty, -\sqrt{3})\) and \((\sqrt{3}, \infty)\text{,}\) and \(f\) is decreasing on \((-\sqrt{3},0)\) and \((0, \sqrt{3})\text{.}\) By the first derivative test, this information tells us that \(f\) has a local maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{3}\) and a local minimum at \(x = \sqrt{3}\text{.}\) Although \(f\) also has a critical number at \(x = 0\text{,}\) neither a maximum nor minimum occurs there since \(f'\) does not change sign at \(x = 0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Next, we move on to investigate concavity. Differentiating \(f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2\text{,}\) we see that \(f''(x) = 12x^3 - 18x\text{.}\) Since we are interested in knowing the intervals on which \(f''\) is positive and negative, we first find where \(f''(x) = 0\text{.}\) Observe that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
0 = 12x^3 - 18x = 12x\left(x^2 - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 12x\left(x+\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\left(x-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This equation has solutions \(x = 0, \pm\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\text{.}\) Building a sign chart for \(f''\) in the exact same way we do for \(f'\text{,}\) we see the result shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-signchart3.html" knowl-id="xref-F-3-1-signchart3" alt="Figure 3.12 " title="Figure 3.12 ">Figure 3.12</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/3_1_signchart3.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">3.12</span>The second derivative sign chart for \(f\) when \(f''(x) = 12x^3-18x = 12x^2\left(x^2-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\text{.}\)</figcaption></figure><p>Therefore, \(f\) is concave down on the intervals \((-\infty, -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}})\) and \((0, \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}})\text{,}\) and concave up on \((-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}},0)\) and \((\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}, \infty)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Putting all of this information together, we now see a complete and accurate possible graph of \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-Ex2.html" knowl-id="xref-F-3-1-Ex2" alt="Figure 3.13 " title="Figure 3.13 ">Figure 3.13</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/3_1_Ex2.svg" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">3.13</span>A possible graph of the function \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/Ex-3-2.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex-3-2" alt="Example 3.10 " title="Example 3.10 ">Example 3.10</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The point \(A = (-\sqrt{3}, f(-\sqrt{3}))\) is a local maximum, because \(f\) is increasing prior to \(A\) and decreasing after; similarly, the point \(E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})\) is a local minimum. Note, too, that \(f\) is concave down at \(A\) and concave up at \(B\text{,}\) which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test. At points \(B\) and \(D\text{,}\) concavity changes, as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in <a knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-signchart3.html" knowl-id="xref-F-3-1-signchart3" alt="Figure 3.12 " title="Figure 3.12 ">Figure 3.12</a>. Finally, at point \(C\text{,}\) \(f\) has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line, but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there, since \(f\) is decreasing both before and after \(C\text{.}\) It is also the case that concavity changes at \(C\text{.}\)</p>
<p>While we completely understand where \(f\) is increasing and decreasing, where \(f\) is concave up and concave down, and where \(f\) has relative extremes, we do not know any specific information about the \(y\)-coordinates of points on the curve. For instance, while we know that \(f\) has a local maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{3}\text{,}\) we don't know the value of that maximum because we do not know \(f(-\sqrt{3})\text{.}\) Any vertical translation of our sketch of \(f\) in <a knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-Ex2.html" knowl-id="xref-F-3-1-Ex2" alt="Figure 3.13 " title="Figure 3.13 ">Figure 3.13</a> would satisfy the given criteria for \(f\text{.}\)</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-1-tests.html#solution-121">in-context</a></span>
