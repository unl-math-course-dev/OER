<p>For example, rather than considering \(f(x) = 2 + \frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\) for every value of \(x\text{,}\) perhaps instead we are only interested in those \(x\) for which \(0 \le x \le 4\text{,}\) and we would like to know which values of \(x\) in the interval \([0,4]\) produce the largest possible and smallest possible values of \(f\text{.}\) We are accustomed to critical numbers playing a key role in determining the location of extreme values of a function; now, by restricting the domain to an interval, it makes sense that the endpoints of the interval will also be important to consider, as we see in the following activity. When limiting ourselves to a particular interval, we will often refer to the <em class="emphasis">absolute</em> maximum or minimum value, rather than the <em class="emphasis">global</em> maximum or minimum.</p>
