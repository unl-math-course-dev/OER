<p>As we pile up miles on our car, we expect the value to go down. However, we should expect the depreciation to be more extreme at first, but less in magnitude as we drive more miles and our car gets older. Note, though, the the value of the car is always decreasing and \(h'(m)\) is always negative. Thus, we should expect that the rate of change of \(h\) is increasing (becoming less negative) as \(m\) increases and that \(h'(30000) \lt h'(80000)\text{.}\)</p>
