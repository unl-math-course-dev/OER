<li><p>For an exponential function \(f(x) = a^x\) \((a \gt 1)\text{,}\) the graph of \(f'(x)\) appears to be a scaled version of the original function. In particular, careful analysis of the graph of\(f(x) = 2^x\text{,}\) suggests that \(\frac{d}{dx}[2^x] = 2^x \ln(2)\text{,}\) which is a special case of the rule we stated in <a href="sec-2-1-elem-rules.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.1 Elementary derivative rules" title="Section 2.1 Elementary derivative rules">SectionÂ 2.1</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>By carefully analyzing the graphs of \(y = \sin(x)\) and \(y = \cos(x)\text{,}\) and by using the limit definition of the derivative at select points, we found that \(\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)] = \cos(x)\) and \(\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)] = -\sin(x)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We note that all previously encountered derivative rules still hold, but now may also be applied to functions involving the sine and cosine. All of the established meaning of the derivative applies to these trigonometric functions as well.</p></li>
