<p>The idea that a differentiable function looks linear and can be well-approximated by a linear function is an important one that finds wide application in calculus. For example, by approximating a function with its local linearization, it is possible to develop an effective algorithm to estimate the zeroes of a function. Local linearity also helps us to make further sense of certain challenging limits. For instance, we have seen that the limit</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>is indeterminate, because both its numerator and denominator tend to 0. While there is no algebra that we can do to simplify \(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\text{,}\) it is straightforward to show that the linearization of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) at the point \((0,0)\) is given by \(L(x) = x\text{.}\) Hence, for values of \(x\) near 0, \(\sin(x) \approx x\text{,}\) and therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \approx \frac{x}{x} = 1\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which makes plausible the fact that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
