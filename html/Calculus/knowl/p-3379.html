<p>Of course, finding \(D\) and \(s(b)-s(a)\) for the graph in <a knowl="./knowl/F-4-2-Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F-4-2-Intro" alt="Figure 4.14 " title="Figure 4.14 ">Figure 4.14</a> presumes that we can actually find the areas \(A_1\text{,}\) \(A_2\text{,}\) and \(A_3\text{.}\) So far, we have worked with velocity functions that were either constant or linear, so that the area bounded by the velocity function and the horizontal axis is a combination of rectangles and triangles, and we can find the area exactly. But when the curve bounds a region that is not a familiar geometric shape, we cannot find its area exactly. Indeed, this is one of our biggest goals in <a href="C-4.html" class="xref" alt="Chapter 4 The Definite Integral" title="Chapter 4 The Definite Integral">Chapter 4</a>: to learn how to find the exact area bounded between a curve and the horizontal axis for as many different types of functions as possible.</p>
