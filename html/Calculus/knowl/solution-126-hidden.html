<p>Since \(h'\) is negative to the left of \(0\) and positive to the right of \(0\text{,}\) the function \(h\) is decreasing for \(x \lt 0\) and increasing for \(x \gt 0\text{.}\) So \(h\) can have at most \(2\) real roots (solutions to \(h(x)=0\text{.}\) As the graphs in the following figure show, it is possible that \(h\) has no real zeros, one real zero, or two real zeros.</p>

<li><p>Given that \(h\) is decreasing for \(x \lt 0\) and increasing for \(x \gt 0\text{,}\) the function \(h\) has an absolute minimum value at \(x=0\text{.}\) So one root is to the left of this minimum and the other to the right. Thus, one root is negative and the other positive. See, for instance, the lowest of the three possibilities for \(h\) shown in the figure in (a).</p></li>
<li><p>The slopes of the tangent lines to \(h\) will all be near \(3\text{,}\) but less than \(3\text{,}\) as \(x\) gets large. So the graph of \(h\) will look very much like a line with slope \(3\) for large values of \(x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We note that \(h'\) is increasing everywhere, \(h\) is concave up everywhere. Since the graph of \(h'\) levels off for large values of \(|x|\text{,}\) the concavity of \(h\) is small when \(|x|\) is large. Also, the largest value of the slope of the tangent line to \(h'\) occurs when \(x=0\text{,}\) so \(h\) has its largest second dervitive when \(x=0\text{.}\) So \(h\) is almost linear as \(x\) decreases without bound, \(h\) has more bend as \(x\) approaches \(0\text{,}\) has its greatest bend at \(x=0\text{,}\) then the second derivative of \(h\) as \(x\) increases, ultimately having \(h\) become almost linear as \(x\) increases without bound.</p></li>
