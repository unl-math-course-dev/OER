<p>Here, we first observe that we are working on the domain of all real numbers, not a closed bounded interval. Hence, we need to think about the overall behavior of the function. First, since \(f(x) = 4 - e^{-(x-2)^2}\text{,}\) by the chain rule we see that \(f'(x) = -e^{-(x-2)^2}(-2(x-2)) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}\text{.}\) Since \(e^{-(x-2)^2}\) is always positive (in particular, never zero), it follows that the only critical number of \(f\) is \(x = 2\text{.}\) Furthermore, with \(f'(x) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}\text{,}\) we see that for \(x \lt 2\text{,}\) \(f'(x) \lt 0\text{,}\) while for \(x \gt 2\text{,}\) \(f'(x) \gt 0\text{.}\) This tells us by the first derivative test that \(f\) is decreasing for \(x \lt 2\) and increasing for \(x \gt 2\text{,}\) which tells us that \(f\) has an absolute minimum at \(x = 2\text{,}\) and \(f\) does not have an absolute maximum.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-3-optimization.html#li-2000">in-context</a></span>
