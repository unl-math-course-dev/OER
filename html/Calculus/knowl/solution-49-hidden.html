<li><p>The only value of \(a\) at which \(\lim_{x \to a} p(x)\) does not exist is \(a = 0\text{.}\) This is because \(\lim_{x \to 0^-} p(x) = 0 \ne -2 = \lim_{x \to 0^+} p(x)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(p\) is not continuous at \(a = 0\) because \(\lim_{x \to 0} p(x)\) does not exist. In addition, \(p\) is not continuous at \(a=3\) because \(p(3)\) is not defined.</p></li>
<li><p>\(p\) is not differentiable at \(a = 0\) and at \(a = 3\) since \(p\) is not continuous at these points. In addition, \(p\) is not differentiable at \(a = -2, 1, 2\) since \(p\) has corner points at these values, making \(p\) not have a tangent line at these values.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Note that \(p\) is piecewise linear, so the value of the derivative of \(p\) (where it exists) is the slope of \(p\text{,}\) which will be constant on each interval where \(p\) is linear. In addition, note that \(p'\) is not defined at \(a = -2, 0, 1, 2, 3\text{,}\) which is reflected by open circles in the following plot.</p>
