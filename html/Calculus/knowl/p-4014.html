<li><p>\(A\) is accumulating positive signed area wherever \(g\) is positive, and thus \(A\) is increasing on \((0,1.5)\text{,}\) \((4,6)\text{;}\) \(A\) is accumulating negative signed area and therefore decreasing wherever \(g\) is negative, which occurs on \((1.5,4)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Here we want to consider where \(A\) is changing at an increasing rate (concave up) or changing at a decreasing rate (concave down). On \((0,1)\) and \((4,5)\text{,}\) \(A\) is increasing, and we can also see that since \(g\) is increasing, \(A\) is increasing at an increasing rate. Similarly, on \((3,4)\) (where \(g\) is negative so \(A\) is decreasing), since \(g\) is increasing it follows that \(A\) is decreasing at an increasing rate. Thus, \(A\) is concave up on \((0,1)\) and \((3,5)\text{.}\) Analogous reasoning shows that \(A\) is concave down on \((1,3)\) and \((5,6)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Based on our work in (a), we see that \(A\) changes from increasing to decreasing at \(x = 1.5\text{,}\) and thus \(A\) has a relative maximum there. Similarly, \(A\) has a relative minimum at \(x = 4\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Using the fact that \(g\) is piecewise linear and the definition of \(A\text{,}\) we find that \(A(0) = \int_1^0 g(t) \, dt = -\int_0^1 g(t) \, dt = -\frac{1}{2}\text{;}\) \(A(1) = \int_1^1 g(t) \, dt = 0\text{;}\) \(A(2) = \int_1^2 g(t) \, dt = 0\text{.}\) Analogous reasoning shows that \(A(3) = -2\text{,}\) \(A(4) = -3.5\text{,}\) \(A(5) = -2\text{,}\) \(A(6) = -0.5\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use your work in (a)-(d) appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that \(B(0) = 0\text{,}\) while \(A(0) = -\frac{1}{2}\text{.}\) Likewise, \(B(1) = \frac{1}{2}\text{,}\) while \(A(1) = 0\text{.}\) Indeed, we can see that for any value of \(x\text{,}\) \(B(x) = A(x) + \frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</p></li>
