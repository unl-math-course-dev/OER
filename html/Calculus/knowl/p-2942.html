<p>In neither of these problems was a function to optimize explicitly provided. Rather, we first tried to understand the problem by drawing a figure and introducing variables, and then sought to develop a formula for a function that modeled the quantity to be optimized. Once the function was established, we then considered what domain was appropriate. At that point, we were finally ready to apply the ideas of calculus to determine the absolute minimum or maximum.</p>
