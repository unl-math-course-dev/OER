<p>As \(x \to 0\text{,}\) we observe that \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) does not behave in an elementary way. When \(x\) is positive and approaching zero, we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values, and \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) increases without bound. When \(x\) is negative and approaching zero, \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) decreases without bound. In this sense, as we get close to \(x = 0\text{,}\) the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly, and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of \(g\) betweem \(1\) and \(-1\text{.}\) If we plot the function \(g(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)\) with a graphing utility and then zoom in on \(x = 0\text{,}\) we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin, which suggests that \(g\) does not have a limit at \(x = 0\text{.}\)</p>
