<p>When we compute an instantaneous rate of change, we allow the interval \([a,a+h]\) to shrink as \(h \to 0\text{.}\) We can think of one endpoint of the interval as “sliding towards” the other. In particular, provided that \(f\) has a derivative at \((a,f(a))\text{,}\) the point \((a+h,f(a+h))\) will approach \((a,f(a))\) as \(h \to 0\text{.}\) Because the process of taking a limit is a dynamic one, it can be helpful to use computing technology to visualize it. One option is a java applet in which the user is able to control the point that is moving. For a helpful collection of examples, consider the <a class="url" href="http://gvsu.edu/s/5r" target="_blank">work of David Austin</a> of Grand Valley State University, and <a class="url" href="http://gvsu.edu/s/5s" target="_blank">this particularly relevant example</a>. For applets that have been built in Geogebra<span class="footnote"><a knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-2" alt="Footnote 1.2 " title="Footnote 1.2 "><sup> 2 </sup></a></span>, see <a class="url" href="http://gvsu.edu/s/5p" target="_blank">Marc Renault's library</a> via Shippensburg University, with <a class="url" href="http://gvsu.edu/s/5q" target="_blank">this example</a> being especially fitting for our work in this section.</p>
