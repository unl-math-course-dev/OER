<li><p>Given the graph of a function \(f\text{,}\) we can construct the graph of its antiderivative \(F\) provided that (a) we know a starting value of \(F\text{,}\) say \(F(a)\text{,}\) and (b) we can evaluate the integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) exactly for relevant choices of \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) For instance, if we wish to know \(F(3)\text{,}\) we can compute \(F(3) = F(a) + \int_a^3 f(x) \, dx\text{.}\) When we combine this information about the function values of \(F\) together with our understanding of how the behavior of \(F' = f\) affects the overall shape of \(F\text{,}\) we can develop a completely accurate graph of the antiderivative \(F\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Because the derivative of a constant is zero, if \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\text{,}\) it follows that \(G(x) = F(x) + C\) will also be an antiderivative of \(f\text{.}\) Moreover, any two antiderivatives of a function \(f\) differ precisely by a constant. Thus, any function with at least one antiderivative in fact has infinitely many, and the graphs of any two antiderivatives will differ only by a vertical translation.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a function \(f\text{,}\) the rule \(A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt\) defines a new function \(A\) that measures the net-signed area bounded by \(f\) on the interval \([a,x]\text{.}\) We call the function \(A\) the integral function corresponding to \(f\text{.}\)</p></li>
