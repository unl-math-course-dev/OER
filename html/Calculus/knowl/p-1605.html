<p>A farmer with large land holdings has historically grown a wide variety of crops. With the price of ethanol fuel rising, he decides that it would be prudent to devote more and more of his acreage to producing corn. As he grows more and more corn, he learns efficiencies that increase his yield per acre. In the present year, he used 7000 acres of his land to grow corn, and that land had an average yield of 170 bushels per acre. At the current time, he plans to increase his number of acres devoted to growing corn at a rate of 600 acres/year, and he expects that right now his average yield is increasing at a rate of 8 bushels per acre per year. Use this information to answer the following questions. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Say that the present year is \(t = 0\text{,}\) that \(A(t)\) denotes the number of acres the farmer devotes to growing corn in year \(t\text{,}\) \(Y(t)\) represents the average yield in year \(t\) (measured in bushels per acre), and \(C(t)\) is the total number of bushels of corn the farmer produces. What is the formula for \(C(t)\) in terms of \(A(t)\) and \(Y(t)\text{?}\) Why?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the value of \(C(0)\text{?}\) What does it measure?</p></li>
<li><p>Write an expression for \(C'(t)\) in terms of \(A(t)\text{,}\) \(A'(t)\text{,}\) \(Y(t)\text{,}\) and \(Y'(t)\text{.}\) Explain your thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the value of \(C'(0)\text{?}\) What does it measure?</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the given information and your work above, estimate the value of \(C(1)\text{.}\)</p></li>
