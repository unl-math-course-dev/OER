<li><p>The value of the numerator at \(x=c\) is \(e^{-c} \ne 0\text{,}\) while the value of the denominator is \(0\) at \(x=c\text{.}\) Thus, \(\lim_{x \to c^+} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = \infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to c^-} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = -\infty\text{.}\) This makes the line \(x=c\) a vertical asymptote for \(q\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>We can write \(q(x)\) as \(q(x) = \frac{1}{(x-c)e^x}\) and thus see the denominator increases without bound as \(x \to \infty\text{.}\) Therefore, \(\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = 0\text{.}\) This makes the line \(y=0\) a horizontal asymptote for \(q\text{.}\) As \(x \to -\infty\text{,}\) \(e^{-x}\) increases without bound, while \((x-c)\) decreases without bound. Thus, \(q\) has an indeterminate form as \(x \to -infty\text{.}\) Applying L'Hopital's Rule gives us</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{-e^{-x}}{1} = -\infty\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using \(q(x) = \frac{1}{(x-c)e^x}\text{,}\) the quotient and product rules along with algebraic simplification show that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
q'(x) = -\frac{(x-c)e^x + e^x}{(x-c)^2\left(e^x\right)^2} = -\frac{x-c+1}{(x-c)^2e^x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The function \(q\) has critical points in its domain where \(q'(x) = 0\) or \(q'(x)\) doesn't exist. Note that \(q'(x)\) is undefined at \(x=c\text{,}\) but \(c\) is not in the domain of mq. Thus, the only critical points of \(q\) occur when \(q'(x)=0\text{.}\) The only way the fraction \(q'(x)\) can be \(0\) is if the numerator is \(0\text{.}\) Since \(x-c+1=0\) when \(x=c-1\text{,}\) the only critical number for \(q\) is \(x=c-1\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The values of the exponential function \(e^x\) and the quadratic \((x-c)^2\) are positive for \(x \neq c\text{,}\) so the sign of \(q'(x) = -\frac{x-c+1}{(x-c)^2e^x}\) depends entirely on the sign of \(x-(c-1)\text{.}\) When \(x \lt c-1\) we see that \(q'(x) \gt 0\) and when \(x \gt c-1\) we have \(q'(x) \lt 0\text{.}\) Thus, \(q\) is increasing on \((-\infty,
c-1)\) and is decreasing on \((c-1,c)\text{,}\) so it follows that \(q(c-1)\) is a relative maximum value. This value is a local maximum, since the value of \(q\) can be made as large as we like as shown in part (b).</p></li>
<li>
<p>We've shown that a typical member of the family of functions given by \(q(x) = \frac{1}{(x-c)e^x}\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = c\) and a critical number at which a local maximum occurs one unit to the left of \(c\) at \(x = c-1\text{.}\) A typical such graph is shown below. Note how \(q\) is increasing and decreasing according to our earlier work in (d).</p>
