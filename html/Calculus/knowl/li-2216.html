<p>When two or more related quantities are changing as implicit functions of time, their rates of change can be related by implicitly differentiating the equation that relates the quantities themselves. For instance, if the sides of a right triangle are all changing as functions of time, say having lengths \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\text{,}\) then these quantities are related by the Pythagorean Theorem: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\text{.}\) It follows by implicitly differentiating with respect to \(t\) that their rates are related by the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so that if we know the values of \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) at a particular time, as well as two of the three rates, we can deduce the value of the third.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-5-rel-rates.html#li-2216">in-context</a></span>
