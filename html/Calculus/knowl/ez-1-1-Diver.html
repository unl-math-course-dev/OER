<p>A diver leaps from a 3 meter springboard. His feet leave the board at time \(t=0\text{,}\) he reaches his maximum height of 4.5 m at \(t = 1.1\) seconds, and enters the water at \(t = 2.45\text{.}\) Once in the water, the diver coasts to the bottom of the pool (depth 3.5 m), touches bottom at \(t=7\text{,}\) rests for one second, and then pushes off the bottom. From there he coasts to the surface, and takes his first breath at \(t=13\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Let \(s(t)\) denote the function that gives the height of the diver's feet (in meters) above the water at time \(t\text{.}\) (Note that the “height” of the bottom of the pool is \(-3.5\) meters.) Sketch a carefully labeled graph of \(s(t)\) on the provided axes in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-1-Ez2a.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-1-Ez2a" alt="Figure 1.7 " title="Figure 1.7 ">Figure 1.7</a>. Include scale and units on the vertical axis. Be as detailed as possible.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Based on your graph in (a), what is the average velocity of the diver between \(t = 2.45\) and \(t=7\text{?}\) Is his average velocity the same on every time interval within \([2.45,7]\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Let the function \(v(t)\) represent the <em class="emphasis">instantaneous vertical velocity</em> of the diver at time \(t\) (i.e. the speed at which the height function \(s(t)\) is changing; note that velocity in the upward direction is positive, while the velocity of a falling object is negative). Based on your understanding of the diver's behavior, as well as your graph of the position function, sketch a carefully labeled graph of \(v(t)\) on the axes provided in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-1-Ez2c.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-1-Ez2c" alt="Figure 1.8 " title="Figure 1.8 ">Figure 1.8</a>. Include scale and units on the vertical axis. Write several sentences that explain how you constructed your graph, discussing when you expect \(v(t)\) to be zero, positive, negative, relatively large, and relatively small.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a connection between the two graphs that you can describe? What can you say about the velocity graph when the height function is increasing? decreasing? Make as many observations as you can.</p></li>
