<body><span class="solution"><p>Let \(x\) be the length of one side of the square bottom and \(h\) the height of one of the sides. We first note that the volume, \(V\text{,}\) of the box is \(V = x^2 h\text{,}\) and the surface area of the box is \(S = 2x^2 +  4xh\text{,}\) since there are two square sides (bottom and top) of area \(x^2\) and four identical sides of area \(xh\text{.}\) Since the material for the top and bottom costs $3.00 per square foot and the material for the sides costs $1.50 per square foot, it follows that the total cost of a box with surface area \(S\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C = 1.50 (2x^2) +  3.00 (4xh) = 3x^2 + 12xh\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We are interested in building box of largest volume for which we spend $15. This cost constraint implies that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
15 = 3x^2 + 12xh\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which allows us to express \(h\) as a function of \(x\) by solving for \(h\text{.}\) Doing so, we see that \(12xh = 15 - 3x^2\text{,}\) so</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h = \frac{15-3x^2}{12x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Using this relationship, we are now able to express the volume, \(V\text{,}\) of the box as a function of the single variable \(x\text{.}\) Subsituting the expression for \(h\text{,}\) we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = x^2 h = x^2 \frac{15-3x^2}{12x} = \frac{1}{12}x(15 - 3x^2) = \frac{15}{12}x - \frac{1}{4}x^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note particularly that in order to have a box, we require that both \(x \gt 0\) and \(h \gt 0\text{.}\) The latter condition along with the fact that \(h = \frac{15-3x^2}{12x}\) shows that we need \(15 - 3x^2 \gt 0\text{,}\) and thus \(x^2 \lt 5\text{,}\) so \(x \lt \sqrt{5}\text{.}\) Hence we are considering \(V(x)\) on the domain \(0 \lt x \lt \sqrt{5}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>It is apparent that the box vanishes (and its volume tends to zero) as either \(x \to 0^+\) or \(x \to \sqrt{5}^-\text{,}\) and thus the absolute maximum volume must appear between these values at a critical number. Differentiating \(V\text{,}\) we find that \(V'(x) = \frac{15}{12} - \frac{3}{4}x^2\text{.}\) Solving \(V'(x) = 0\) to find all critical numbers of \(V\) in the domain, we see that \(x^2 = \frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{3}\text{,}\) and thus \(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\text{,}\) so only \(x = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\) is a critical number that lies in \(0 \lt x \lt \sqrt{5}\text{.}\) Noting that the absolute minimum volume \(V = 0\) occurs at each endpoint, it must be the case that the absolute maximum volume is \(V\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) = \frac{15}{12}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) - \frac{1}{4}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right)^3 \approx 1.07583\) cubic feet.</p></span></body>
