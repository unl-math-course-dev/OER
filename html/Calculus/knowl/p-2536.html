<p>From our sketch of the second derivative in (b), we can develop a second derivative sign chart for \(f\text{.}\) In particular, we saw that \(f''(x) = 0\) at \(x \approx -0.35\) and at \(x = 1\text{,}\) and that between these points, \(f''(x)\) is negative, while \(f''(x)\) is positive everywhere else. This shows that \(f\) is concave down for \(-0.35 \lt x \lt 1\) while being concave up everywhere else. We thus see that \(f\) has points of inflection at both \(x \approx -0.35\) and \(x = 1\text{.}\)</p>
