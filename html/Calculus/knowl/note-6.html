<li><p>Identify the quantities in the problem that are changing and choose clearly defined variable names for them. Draw one or more figures that clearly represent the situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine all rates of change that are known or given and identify the rate(s) of change to be found.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an equation that relates the variables whose rates of change are known to those variables whose rates of change are to be found.</p></li>
<li><p>Differentiate implicitly with respect to \(t\) to relate the rates of change of the involved quantities.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the derivatives and variables at the information relevant to the instant at which a certain rate of change is sought. Use proper notation to identify when a derivative is being evaluated at a particular instant, such as \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\text{.}\)</p></li>
