<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If we know the velocity of a moving body at every point in a given interval and the velocity is positive throughout, we can estimate the object's distance traveled and in some circumstances determine this value exactly.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, when velocity is positive on an interval, we can find the total distance traveled by finding the area under the velocity curve and above the \(t\)-axis on the given time interval. We may only be able to estimate this area, depending on the shape of the velocity curve.</p></li>
<li><p>An antiderivative of a function \(f\) is a new function \(F\) whose derivative is \(f\text{.}\) That is, \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\) provided that \(F' = f\text{.}\) In the context of velocity and position, if we know a velocity function \(v\text{,}\) an antiderivative of \(v\) is a position function \(s\) that satisfies \(s' = v\text{.}\) If \(v\) is positive on a given interval, say \([a,b]\text{,}\) then the change in position, \(s(b) - s(a)\text{,}\) measures the distance the moving object traveled on \([a,b]\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If its velocity is sometimes negative, a moving object is sometimes traveling in the opposite direction or backtracking. To determine distance traveled, we have to think compute the distance separately on intervals where velocity is positive or negative, and account for the change in position on each such interval.</p></li>
