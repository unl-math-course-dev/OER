<p>Given a composite function \(C(x) = f(g(x))\) that is built from differentiable functions \(f\) and \(g\text{,}\) how do we compute \(C'(x)\) in terms of \(f\text{,}\) \(g\text{,}\) \(f'\text{,}\) and \(g'\text{?}\) In the same way that the rate of change of a product of two functions, \(p(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\text{,}\) depends on the behavior of both \(f\) and \(g\text{,}\) it makes sense intuitively that the rate of change of a composite function \(C(x) = f(g(x))\) will also depend on some combination of \(f\) and \(g\) and their derivatives. The rule that describes how to compute \(C'\) in terms of \(f\) and \(g\) and their derivatives is called the <em class="emphasis">chain rule</em>.</p>
