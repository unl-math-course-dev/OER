<p>In <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-concavity.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-concavity" alt="Figure 1.53 " title="Figure 1.53 ">Figure 1.53</a>, we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each. On the lefthand plot, where the function is concave up, observe that the tangent lines always lie below the curve itself, and the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing as we move from left to right. In other words, the function \(f\) is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative, \(f'\text{,}\) is increasing on that interval. Similarly, on the righthand plot in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-concavity.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-concavity" alt="Figure 1.53 " title="Figure 1.53 ">Figure 1.53</a>, where the function shown is concave down, we see that the tangent lines alway lie above the curve, and the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right. The fact that its derivative, \(f'\text{,}\) is decreasing makes \(f\) concave down on the interval.</p>
