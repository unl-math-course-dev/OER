<p>To find where \(a(t)\) is greatest, we recall that \(a(t) = v'(t)\text{,}\) so we are seeking the location where the slope of the tangent line to \(v(t)\) is maximized on the interval \([0,24]\text{.}\) From the graph, there are only two possible intervals where this can occur: \(0 \lt t \lt 4\) and \(12 \lt t \lt 16\text{,}\) as these are both where \(v\) is increasing and thus \(a(t) = v'(t)\) is positive.</p>
<p>On \(12 \lt t \lt 16\text{,}\) \(a(t) = v'(t) = \frac{3}{2}\) since this is the slope of the line that forms \(v(t)\) on this interval. On \(0 \lt t \lt 4\text{,}\) \(v(t) = -\frac{1}{4}t^3 + \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 1\text{,}\) so \(a(t) = v'(t) = -\frac{3}{4}t^2 + 3t\text{.}\) We see that \(a(t)\) is a quadratic function that opens down, so its maximum occurs at its vertex, which is located where \(a'(t) = 0\text{.}\) We know that \(a'(t) = -\frac{3}{2}t + 3\text{,}\) and \(0 = -\frac{3}{2}t + 3\) implies \(t = 2\text{.}\) Moreover, \(a(2) = v'(2) = -\frac{3}{4} \cdot 2^2 + 3(2) = 3\text{.}\) Clearly \(a(2) = 3 \gt \frac{3}{2}\text{,}\) so the object's maximum acceleration is \(3\) meters per minute per minute at the instant \(t = 2\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-4-4-FTC.html#li-2649">in-context</a></span>
