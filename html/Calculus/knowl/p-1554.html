<li><p>If a function is a sum, product, or quotient of simpler functions, then we can use the sum, product, or quotient rules to differentiate it in terms of the simpler functions and their derivatives.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The product rule tells us that if \(P\) is a product of differentiable functions \(f\) and \(g\) according to the rule \(P(x) = f(x) g(x)\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P'(x) = f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quotient rule tells us that if \(Q\) is a quotient of differentiable functions \(f\) and \(g\) according to the rule \(Q(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
Q'(x) = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along with the constant multiple and sum rules, the product and quotient rules enable us to compute the derivative of any function that consists of sums, constant multiples, products, and quotients of basic functions. For instance, if \(F\) has the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
F(x) = \frac{2a(x) - 5b(x)}{c(x) \cdot d(x)}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>then \(F\) is a quotient, in which the numerator is a sum of constant multiples and the denominator is a product. This, the derivative of \(F\) can be found by applying the quotient rule and then using the sum and constant multiple rules to differentiate the numerator and the product rule to differentiate the denominator.</p>
