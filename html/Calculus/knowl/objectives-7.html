<li><p>What does it mean graphically to say that \(f\) has limit \(L\) as \(x \to a\text{?}\) How is this connected to having a left-hand limit at \(x = a\) and having a right-hand limit at \(x = a\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean to say that a function \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\text{?}\) What role do limits play in determining whether or not a function is continuous at a point?</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean graphically to say that a function \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\text{?}\) How is this connected to the function being locally linear?</p></li>
<li><p>How are the characteristics of a function having a limit, being continuous, and being differentiable at a given point related to one another?</p></li>
