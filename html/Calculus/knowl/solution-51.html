<li><p>The function \(h\) must be piecewise linear since its derivative is piecewise constant. That is, wherever \(h'\) is constant, \(h\) must be linear. In particular, \(h\) must be piecewise linear with slope of \(1\) or \(-1\text{,}\) depending on the interval.</p></li>
<li><p>\(h'(x)\) is not defined for \(x = -2, 0, 2\text{,}\) as reflected by the open circles on the graph of \(h'\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible that \(h\) is not continuous at \(x = -2, 0, 2\text{,}\) since \(h\) is not differnetiable at these points; everywhere else, \(h\) must be continuous.</p></li>
<li>
<p>There are many different possible graphs for \(h\text{.}\) Two of them are shown in the following figure. The blue graph is one possible version of \(h\) that is continuous. Note that we can vertically shift that graph and its derivative will still be the given \(h'\text{.}\) Moreover, we can vertically shift any of the piecewise linear portions of \(h\) to generate a graph such as the one shown in red, which also has derivative \(h'\text{.}\)</p>
