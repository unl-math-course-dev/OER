<li><p>By finding the area of the triangular regions formed between \(y = v(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis on \([0,1]\) and \([1,2]\) (each of which is \(1\)), it follows that the object's total distance traveled is \(2\text{,}\) while its change in position is \(0\text{.}\) The latter is true since the net signed area bounded by \(v\) on \([0,2]\) is \(1 - 1 = 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The object's position is increasing wherever its velocity is positive, hence for \(0 \le t \lt 1\) and \(4 \lt t \lt 8 \text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>By calculating the area bounded by the curve, we find 1 unit of area on \([0,1]\text{,}\) 4 units of area on \([1,4]\text{,}\) and 8 units of area on \([4,8]\text{,}\) thus the total distance traveled on \(0 \le t \le 8\) is \(D = 1 + 4 + 8\) meters. As the change in position is given by the net signed area on this interval, we find that the change in position is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
s(8) - s(0) = 1 - 4 + 8 = 5 \ \mbox{m}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>In the figure below, at left we list all of the areas bounded by \(v\) on each one-unit subinterval. Along with the given starting point that \(s(0) = 1\text{,}\) we use the resulting changes in position to plot points for the function \(s\text{.}\) For instance, we know \(s(1) - s(0) = 1\text{,}\) hence \(s(1) = 2\text{.}\) Similarly, \(s(2) - s(1) = -1\text{,}\) thus \(s(2) = 1\text{.}\) Continuing across the interval, we generate the function \(s\) that is pictured at right. Note that the portion of \(s\) from \(t = 2\) to \(t = 3\) is linear because \(v\) is constant there, while the other parts of \(s\) appear to be quadratic, as they correspond to intervals where \(v\) is linear.</p></li>
