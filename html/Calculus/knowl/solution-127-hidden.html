<li><p>Note that \(p''(x)=0\) at \(x=-1\) and \(x=2\text{.}\) The second derivative sign chart for \(p\) shows that \(p''(x)\) is negative for \(-1 \lt x \lt 2\) and positive for all other values of \(x\text{.}\) Since \(p''\) changes sign at \(x = -1\) and \(x = 2\text{,}\) \(p\) has points of inflection at \(x = -1\) and \(x = 2\text{.}\) In particular, \(p\) is concave down for \(-1 \lt x \lt 2\) and concave up for all other values of \(x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If we compute \(p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right)\text{,}\) we find that \(p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right) \approx -1.205\text{,}\) which means that \(p\) is concave down at \(x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\text{.}\) Since \(p\) has a horizontal tangent line at this point, it follows that \(p\) has a local maximum at \(x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\) by the second derivative test.</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(p(2) = \frac{12}{e^2}\) and \(p'(2) = -\frac{5}{e^2}\text{,}\) the equation of the tangent line to \(p\) at \(x = 2\) is given by \(y = -\frac{5}{e^2}(x-2) + \frac{12}{e^2}\text{.}\) To determine whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of \(y=p(x)\) at \(x = 2\text{,}\) we consider the concavity of \(p\text{.}\) Recall we know that \(p''(2) = 0\) and that \(p\) is concave down to the left of \(x = 2\) and concave up to the right. Thus, the tangent line lies neither solely below nor solely above the graph of \(y = p(x)\) at \(x = 2\text{;}\) it lies below \(y = p(x)\) to the right of \(x = 2\) and above \(y = p(x)\) to the left of \(x = 2\text{.}\)</p></li>
