</h6>While this example highlights why the product rule is true, there are some subtle issues to recognize. For one, if the stock's value really does rise exactly $0.75 on day 100, and the number of shares really rises by 12 on day 100, then we'd expect that \(V(101) = N(101) \cdot S(101) = 532 \cdot 28.25 = 15029\text{.}\) If, as noted above, we expect the total value to rise by $720, then with \(V(100) = N(100) \cdot S(100) = 520 \cdot 27.50 = 14300\text{,}\) then it seems we should find that \(V(101) = V(100) + 720 = 15020\text{.}\) Why do the two results differ by 9? One way to understand why this difference occurs is to recognize that \(N'(100) = 12\) represents an <em class="emphasis">instantaneous</em> rate of change, while our (informal) discussion has also thought of this number as the total change in the number of shares over the course of a single day. The formal proof of the product rule reconciles this issue by taking the limit as the change in the input tends to zero.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-2-3-prod-quot.html#fn-12">in-context</a></span>
