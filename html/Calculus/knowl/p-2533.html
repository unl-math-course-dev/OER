<li><p>From the given graph of \(f'\text{,}\) the first derivative sign chart for \(f\) shows that \(f\) has critical numbers at \(x = -1, 1\) and that \(f'\) is positive for \(-1 \lt x lt 1\) and for \(x \gt 1\text{,}\) while being negative for all \(x \lt -1\text{.}\) Hence \(f\) is increasing for \(-1 \lt x lt 1\) and for \(x \gt 1\text{,}\) and decreasing for \(x \lt -1\text{.}\) It follows by the first derivative test that \(f\) has a local minimum at \(x = -1\) because \(f\) changes from decreasing to increasing there.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on where \(f'(x)\) has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative, we can sketch an approximate graph of \(y = f''(x)\) in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function. From the given graph of \(y = f'(x)\text{,}\) we can see that \(f''(x) = 0\) at \(x \approx -0.35\) and at \(x = 1\text{,}\) and that between these points, \(f''(x)\) is negative because \(f'(x)\) is decreasing, while \(f''(x)\) is positive everywhere else since \(f'(x)\) is increasing everywhere else. A possible graph of \(y = f''(x)\) is shown at right in the following figure.</p></li>
<li><p>From our sketch of the second derivative in (b), we can develop a second derivative sign chart for \(f\text{.}\) In particular, we saw that \(f''(x) = 0\) at \(x \approx -0.35\) and at \(x = 1\text{,}\) and that between these points, \(f''(x)\) is negative, while \(f''(x)\) is positive everywhere else. This shows that \(f\) is concave down for \(-0.35 \lt x \lt 1\) while being concave up everywhere else. We thus see that \(f\) has points of inflection at both \(x \approx -0.35\) and \(x = 1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Now that we know where \(f\) is increasing and decreasing as well as where \(f\) is concave up and concave down, along with the fact that \(f(0) = -0.5\text{,}\) we can sketch an approximate graph of \(y = f(x)\text{.}\) Note that we also know \(f\) has a horizontal tangent line at \(x = 1\) while being increasing on either side of \(x = 1\text{,}\) and earlier we established that \(f\) has a local minimum at \(x = -1\text{.}\) After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through \((0,-0.5)\text{,}\) we arrive at the graph shown at left below.</p>
