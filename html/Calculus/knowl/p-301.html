<li><p>For this problem, you should draw a graph so that the slope of the secant line from \((-3,f(-3))\) to \((0,f(0))\) is \(-2\text{,}\) and similarly the slope of the secant line from \((1,f(1))\) to \((3,f(3))\) is \(0.5\text{,}\) while the slopes of the tangent lines at \(x = -1\) and \(x = 2\) are \(-1\) and \(1\text{,}\) respectively. For instance, you could let \(f(-3) = 3\) and have \(f\) pass through the points \((-3,3)\text{,}\) \((-1,-2)\text{,}\) \((0,-3)\text{,}\) \((1,-2)\text{,}\) and \((3,-1)\) and draw the desired tangent lines accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>For this problem, you should draw a graph so that the slope of the secant line from \((-2,g(-2))\) to \((3,f(3))\) is \(0\text{,}\) and similarly the slope of the secant line from \((-1,g(-1))\) to \((1,g(1))\) is \(-1\text{,}\) while the slopes of the tangent lines to \(y = g(x)\) at \(x=-1\) and \(x = 2\) are \(0\) and \(1\text{,}\) respectively. For instance, you could draw a function \(g\) that passes through the points \((-2,3)\text{,}\) \((-1,2)\text{,}\) \((1,0)\text{,}\) \((2,0)\text{,}\) and \((3,3)\) in such a way that the tangent line at \((-1,2)\) is horizontal and the tangent line at \((2,0)\) has slope \(1\text{.}\)</p></li>
