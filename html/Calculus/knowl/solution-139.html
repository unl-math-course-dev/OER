<li><p>It's not possible to say without more information: for instance, the functions \(f(x) = e^{-x}\text{,}\) \(f(x) = e^{-x}\text{,}\) and \(f(x) = x^2\) are each always concave up, but only one of them has a global minimum. We can say for sure that by being always concave up, \(f\) cannot have a global maximum, and it also cannot have both a global maximum and a global minimum. It might have a global minimum, or it might have neither.</p></li>
<li><p>By being twice differentiable, we know that \(g'(x) = 0\) any time \(x\) is a critical number of \(g\text{.}\) Thus, given the signs of \(g'(x)\) on the stated intervals, \(g\) is decreasing before \(x = a\) and decreasing on \(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\) with a horizontal tangent line at \(x = a\text{.}\) In addition, \(g\) is increasing for \(x \gt b\text{.}\) Thus, we know that \(g\) has a global minimum at \(x = a\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(h\) is always decreasing for \(x \lt a\text{,}\) always increasing for \(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\) and always decreasing for \(x \gt b\text{,}\) we know that \(h\) has a local minimum at \(x = a\) and a local maximum at \(x = b\text{.}\) Moreover, these local extremes are both global extremes since \(h(x) to 0\) as \(x \to \pm \infty\text{.}\) In particular, since \(h(x)\) decreases to \(0\) for \(x \gt b\) and increases on \(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\) it follows that \(h(b)\) is the largest value of \(h(x)\) on \((a, \infty)\text{,}\) and that \(h(b) \gt 0\text{.}\) Similarly, since \(h(x)\) decreases on \((-\infty,
a)\) and approaches \(0\) as \(x \to -\infty\text{,}\) and \(h(x)\) increases on \(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\) it must be the case that \(h(a)\) is the least value of \(h(x)\) on \((-\infty,
b)\) and that \(h(b) \lt 0\text{.}\) Hence, \(h(x)\) is always negative on \(x \lt a\) and \(h(x)\) is always positive on \(x \gt b\text{.}\) From all of these observations, it follows that \(h\) has a global minimum at \(x = a\) and a global maximum at \(x = b\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>First, observe that \(p\) is defined for all real numbers by assumption, so \(p(a)\) has some finite value. However, \(p\) is not differentiable at \(x = a\) and \(p\) is concave up to the left of \(x = a\) and concave down to the right of \(x = a\text{.}\) This indicates that \(p\) has a relative maximum at \(x = a\text{.}\) Not enough information is provided, however, to determine if this relative maximum is a global maximum, nor if \(p\) happens to have a global minimum at some other point.</p></li>
