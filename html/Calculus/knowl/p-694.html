<p>The value \(F''(30) \approx -0.119\text{,}\) which is measured in degrees per minute per minute tells us, along with the other data, that at the moment \(t = 30\text{,}\) the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees, that its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute, and that the rate at which the temperature is rising is <em class="emphasis">falling</em> at a rate of -0.119 degrees per minute per minute. That is, while the temperature is rising, it is rising at a slower and slower rate. At \(t = 31\text{,}\) we'd expect that the rate of increase of the potato's temperature would have dropped to about 3.73 degrees per minute.</p>
