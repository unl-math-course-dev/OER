<p>In light of the earlier example involving shares of stock, the product rule also makes sense intuitively: the rate of change of \(P\) should take into account both how fast \(f\) and \(g\) are changing, as well as how large \(f\) and \(g\) are at the point of interest. In words the product rule says: if \(P\) is the product of two functions \(f\) (the first function) and \(g\) (the second), then “the derivative of \(P\) is the first times the derivative of the second, plus the second times the derivative of the first.” It is often a helpful mental exercise to say this phrasing aloud when executing the product rule.</p>
