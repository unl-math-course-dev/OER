<li><p>Approximately how far north of Pigeon Lake was the cyclist when she was the greatest distance away from Pigeon Lake? At what time did this occur?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the cyclist's total change in position on the time interval \(0 \le t \le 2\text{?}\) At \(t = 2\text{,}\) was she north or south of Pigeon Lake?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the total distance the biker traveled on \(0 \le t \le 4\text{?}\) At the end of the ride, how close was she to the point at which she started?</p></li>
<li><p>Sketch an approximate graph of \(y = s(t)\text{,}\) the position function of the cyclist, on the interval \(0 \le t \le 4\text{.}\) Label at least four important points on the graph of \(s\text{.}\)</p></li>
