<p>We recall that a function \(f\) is said to be differentiable at \(x = a\) if \(f'(a)\) exists. Moreover, for \(f'(a)\) to exist, we know that the function \(y = f(x)\) must have a tangent line at the point \((a,f(a))\text{,}\) since \(f'(a)\) is precisely the slope of this line. In order to even ask if \(f\) has a tangent line at \((a,f(a))\text{,}\) it is necessary that \(f\) be continuous at \(x = a\text{:}\) if \(f\) fails to have a limit at \(x = a\text{,}\) if \(f(a)\) is not defined, or if \(f(a)\) does not equal the value of \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\text{,}\) then it doesn't make sense to talk about a tangent line to the curve at this point.</p>
