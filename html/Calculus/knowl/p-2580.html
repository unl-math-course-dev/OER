<p>Mathematicians are often interested in making general observations, say by describing patterns that hold in a large number of cases. Think about the Pythagorean Theorem: it doesn't tell us something about a single right triangle, but rather a fact about <em class="emphasis">every</em> right triangle. In the next part of our studies, we use calculus to make general observations about families of functions that depend on one or more parameters. People who use applied mathematics, such as engineers and economists, often encounter the same types of functions where only small changes to certain constants occur. These constants are called <em class="emphasis">parameters</em>.</p>
