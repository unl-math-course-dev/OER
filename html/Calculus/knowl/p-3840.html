<p>Suppose that pollutants are leaking out of an underground storage tank at a rate of \(r(t)\) gallons/day, where \(t\) is measured in days. It is conjectured that \(r(t)\) is given by the formula \(r(t) = 0.0069t^3 -0.125t^2+11.079\) over a certain 12-day period. The graph of \(y=r(t)\) is given in <a knowl="./knowl/F-4-4-TCTEx.html" knowl-id="xref-F-4-4-TCTEx" alt="Figure 4.43 " title="Figure 4.43 ">FigureÂ 4.43</a>. What is the meaning of \(\int_4^{10} r(t) \, dt\) and what is its value? What is the average rate at which pollutants are leaving the tank on the time interval \(4 \le t \le 10\text{?}\)</p>
