<p>In addition to finding instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time, we can often make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time. For instance, when a conical tank is filling with water at a constant rate, it seems obvious that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time. Note how carefully we must phrase the relationship: we mean to say that while the depth, \(h\text{,}\) of the water is increasing, its rate of change, \(\frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}\) is decreasing (both as a function of \(t\) and as a function of \(h\)). We make this observation by solving the equation that relates the various rates for one particular rate, without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates. For instance, in the conical tank problem in <a knowl="./knowl/act-3-5-1.html" knowl-id="xref-act-3-5-1" alt="Activity 3.19 " title="Activity 3.19 ">ActivityÂ 3.19</a>, we established that</p>

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and hence</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{16}{\pi h^2} \frac{dV}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
