<p>Here we want to consider where \(A\) is changing at an increasing rate (concave up) or changing at a decreasing rate (concave down). On \((0,1)\) and \((4,5)\text{,}\) \(A\) is increasing, and we can also see that since \(g\) is increasing, \(A\) is increasing at an increasing rate. Similarly, on \((3,4)\) (where \(g\) is negative so \(A\) is decreasing), since \(g\) is increasing it follows that \(A\) is decreasing at an increasing rate. Thus, \(A\) is concave up on \((0,1)\) and \((3,5)\text{.}\) Analogous reasoning shows that \(A\) is concave down on \((1,3)\) and \((5,6)\text{.}\)</p>
