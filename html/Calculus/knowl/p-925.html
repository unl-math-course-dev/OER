<p>There are many different possible graphs for \(h\text{.}\) Two of them are shown in the following figure. The blue graph is one possible version of \(h\) that is continuous. Note that we can vertically shift that graph and its derivative will still be the given \(h'\text{.}\) Moreover, we can vertically shift any of the piecewise linear portions of \(h\) to generate a graph such as the one shown in red, which also has derivative \(h'\text{.}\)</p>
