<p> At this point we have started to see a close connection between average velocity and instantaneous velocity. Each is connected not only to the physical behavior of the moving object but also to the geometric behavior of the graph of the position function. We are interested in computing average velocities on the interval \([a,b]\) for smaller and smaller intervals. In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal, think of the value \(b\) as \(b = a + h\text{,}\) where \(h\) is a small (non-zero) number that is allowed to vary. Then the average velocity of the object on the interval \([a,a+h]\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>with the denominator being simply \(h\) because \((a+h) - a = h\text{.}\) Note that when \(h \lt  0\text{,}\) \(AV_{[a,a+h]}\) measures the average velocity on the interval \([a+h,a]\text{.}\)</p>
