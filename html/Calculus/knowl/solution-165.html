<li><p>Setting \(v(t) = 0\text{,}\) we find \(500 - 32t = 0\text{,}\) and thus \(t = \frac{500}{32} = \frac{125}{8} = 15.625\text{.}\) This is the time that the rocket's velocity changes from positive to negative, and thus the point when the rocket's position changes from increasing to decreasing: it's when the rocket reaches its maximum height.</p></li>
<li><p>Since \(v\) is a positive linear function that connects the points \((0,500)\) and \((15.625,0)\) on the interval \([0, 15.625]\text{,}\) the region enclosed by the velocity function and the \(t\)-axis is a right triangle with vertical leg of length \(500\) and horizontal leg of length \(15.625\text{.}\) The area of this triangle is \(A = \frac{1}{2}bh = \frac{1}{2}(15.625)(500) = 3906.25\text{.}\) Because this is the area under the velocity curve (where velocity is positive) this area represents the vertical distance traveled by the rocket on the time interval \([0, 15.625]\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>One function that has derivative \(v(t) = s'(t) = 500-32t\) is \(s(t) = 500t - 16t^2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Using our result in (c), \(s(15.625) - s(0) = 500(15.625) - 16(15.625)^2 - (0 - 0) = 3906.25\text{.}\) Thus, the change of the rocket's position on \([0,15.625]\) is \(3906.25\) feet, which is also the distance the rocket traveled vertically on the time interval, since velocity is positive throughout.</p></li>
<li><p>We find that \(s(5) - s(1) = 1616\text{,}\) which tells us that the rocket rose \(1616\) feet on the \(4\)-second interval from \(t = 1\) to \(t = 5\text{.}\)</p></li>
