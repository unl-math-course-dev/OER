<p>Recall that the statement \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L\text{,}\) means that can make \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we'd like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal) to \(a\text{.}\) We now expand this notation and language to include the possibility that either \(L\) or \(a\) can be \(\infty\text{.}\) For instance, for \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\text{,}\) we now write</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>by which we mean that we can make \(\frac{1}{x}\) as large as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal) to 0. In a similar way, we write</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>since we can make \(\frac{1}{x}\) as close to 0 as we'd like by taking \(x\) sufficiently large (i.e., by letting \(x\) increase without bound).</p>
