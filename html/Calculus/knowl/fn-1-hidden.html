<body><span class="footnote">What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit. To be completely precise, it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say “as close to \(L\) as we like” and “sufficiently close to \(a\text{.}\)” That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits. The definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.</span></body>
