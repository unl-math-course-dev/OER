<li><p>The function \(p\) is differentiable at points where its graph is locally linear or smooth. Since there are sharp corners in the graph of \(p\) at \(x=-1\) and \(x=1\text{,}\) we see that \(p\) is not differentiable at those points. Similarly, the sharp corners in \(q\) at \(x=-1\) and \(x=1\) mean that \(q\) is not differentiable at these points, either.</p></li>
<li><p>In order for \(r\) to be differentiable at a point, both \(p\) and \(q\) must be differentiable at the point. So \(r\) is not differentiable at \(x=-1\) and \(x=1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Using the sum and scalar multiple rules, we have \(r'(x) = p'(x) + 2q'(x)\text{.}\) The slope of \(p\) at \(x=-2\) is \(-2\) and the slope of \(q\) at \(x=-2\) is \(3\text{,}\) so \(p'(-2) = -2\) and \(q'(-2) = 3\text{.}\) It follows that \('(-2) = p'(-2) + 2q'(-2) = (-2) + 2(3) = 4\text{.}\) Similarly, the slope of \(p\) at \(x=0\) is \(1\) and the slope of \(q\) at \(x=0\) is \(0\text{,}\) so \(p'(0) = 1\) and \(q'(0) = 0\text{.}\) It follows that \(r'(0) = p'(0) + 2q'(0) = (1) + 2(0) = 1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Note that \(r(2) = p(2)+2q(2) = 2+2(1) = 4\) and \(r'(2) = p'(2)+2q'(2) = 2+2(-1) = 0\text{.}\) Thus, the line tangent to the graph of \(r\) at \(x=2\) is \(y = r(2) + r'(2)(x-2) = 4\text{.}\)</p></li>
