<p>We returned to this question in even more detail in <a href="sec-4-1-velocity-distance.html" class="xref" alt="Section 4.1 Determining distance traveled from velocity" title="Section 4.1 Determining distance traveled from velocity">SectionÂ 4.1</a>. In that setting, we knew the instantaneous velocity of a moving object and worked to determine as much as possible about the object's position function. We found connections between the net signed area under the velocity function and the corresponding change in position of the function, and the Total Change Theorem further illuminated these connections between \(f'\) and \(f\text{,}\) showing that the total change in the value of \(f\) over an interval \([a,b]\) is determined by the net signed area bounded by \(f'\) and the \(x\)-axis on the same interval.</p>
