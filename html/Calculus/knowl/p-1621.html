<p>We know \(A(0) = 7000\) and \(Y(0) = 170\text{.}\) We are also given that the farmer will increase his number of acres devoted to growing corn at a rate of \(600\) acres/year, and he expects that right now his average yield is increasing at a rate of \(8\) bushels per acre per year. This tells us that \(A'(t) = 600\) and \(Y'(0) = 8\text{.}\) So</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C'(0) = A(0)Y'(0) + A'(0)Y(0) = (7000)(8) + (600)(170) = 158 000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that the units of \(A(t)\) are acres and the units of \(Y'(t)\) are bushels per acre per year. So the units of \(A(0)Y'(0)\) are bushels per year. Similarly, the units of \(A'(t)\) are acres per year and the units of \(Y(t)\) are bushels per acre, so the units of \(A'(0)Y(0)\) are also bushels per acre. So the units of \(C'(0)\) are bushels per acre. Therefore, \(C'(0) = 158 000\) tells us that the number of bushels the farmer can produce will increase by approximately \(158 000\) bushels for each year past the present year.</p>
