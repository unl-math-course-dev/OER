<p>Along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan from Lake Macatawa (near Holland) to Grand Haven, there is a bike bath that runs almost directly north-south. For the purposes of this problem, assume the road is completely straight, and that the function \(s(t)\) tracks the position of the biker along this path in miles north of Pigeon Lake, which lies roughly halfway between the ends of the bike path.</p>
<p>Suppose that the biker's velocity function is given by the graph in <a knowl="./knowl/F-4-1-Ez1.html" knowl-id="xref-F-4-1-Ez1" alt="Figure 4.11 " title="Figure 4.11 ">FigureÂ 4.11</a> on the time interval \(0 \le t \le 4\) (where \(t\) is measured in hours), and that \(s(0) = 1\text{.}\)</p>
