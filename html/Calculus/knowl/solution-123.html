<p>In the graph below, \(h(x) = x^2 + \cos(3x)\) is given in dark blue, while \(h(x) = x^2 + \cos(1.6x)\) is shown in light blue.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:30%;margin-right:30%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/3_1_Act3Soln.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>Close inspection of the light blue graph reveals some subtle changes in concavity around \(x \approx \pm 0.5\text{.}\) For values smaller than \(1.6\text{,}\) it is very hard to visually detect any inflection points in \(h(x)\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treating \(k\) as an arbitrary constant, we first observe that \(h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)\text{.}\) Again treating \(k\) as a constant and differentiating, we find</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h''(x) = 2 - k^2\cos(kx)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We seek the values of \(x\) for which \(h''(x) = 0\) at which \(h''\) changes sign. Setting \(h''(x) = 0\) and rearranging the resulting equation, we now seek \(x\) such that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
k^2 \cos(kx) = 2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, remember that \(k\) is an arbitrary positive constant and recall that \(-1 \le \cos(\theta) \le 1\) for all input values \(\theta\text{.}\) If \(\frac{2}{k^2} \gt 1\text{,}\) then the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solution. Hence, whenever \(k^2 \lt  2\text{,}\) or \(k \lt  \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\text{,}\) it follows that the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solutions \(x\text{,}\) which means that \(h''(x)\) is never zero (indeed, for these \(k\)-values, \(h''(x)\) is always positive so that \(h\) is always concave up). On the other hand, if \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\text{,}\) then \(\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1\text{,}\) which guarantees that \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has infinitely many solutions, due to the periodicity of the cosine function. At each such point, \(h''(x) = 2 - k^2 \cos(kx)\) changes sign, and therefore \(h\) has infinitely many inflection points whenever \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To see why \(h\) can only have a finite number of critical numbers regardless of the value of \(k\text{,}\) consider the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
0 = h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which implies that \(2x = k\sin(kx)\text{.}\) Since \(-1 \le \sin(kx) \le 1\text{,}\) we know that \(-k \le k\sin(kx) \le k\text{.}\) Once \(|x|\) is sufficiently large, we are guaranteed that \(|2x| \gt k\text{,}\) which means that for large \(x\text{,}\) \(2x\) and \(k\sin(kx)\) cannot intersect. Moreover, for relatively small values of \(x\text{,}\) the functions \(2x\) and \(k\sin(kx)\) can only intersect finitely many times since \(k\sin(kx)\) oscillates a finite number of times. This is why \(h\) can only have a finite number of critical numbers, regardless of the value of \(k\text{.}\)</p>
