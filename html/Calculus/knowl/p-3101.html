<p>Recognizing which geometric relationships are relevant in a given problem is often the key to finding the function to optimize. For instance, although the problem in <a knowl="./knowl/act-3-5-1.html" knowl-id="xref-act-3-5-1" alt="Activity 3.19 " title="Activity 3.19 ">ActivityÂ 3.19</a> is about a conical tank, the most important fact is that there are two similar right triangles involved. In another setting, we might use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the legs of the triangle. But in the conical tank, the fact that the water fills the tank so that that the ratio of radius to depth is constant turns out to be the important relationship. In other situations where a changing angle is involved, trigonometric functions may provide the means to find relationships among various parts of the triangle.</p>
