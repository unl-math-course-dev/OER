<p>The variables in this problem are the volume \(V\) of water in the pool and the depth \(y\) of water in the pool (measured at the deepest point of the pool); each is implicitly a function of time, \(t\text{.}\) We are given that \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) is a constant \(800\) cubic feet per minute and want to find \(\frac{dh}{dt}\bigm|_{h=5}\text{.}\) To do this, we first need to relate \(V\) and \(h\text{.}\) The volume of the water in the pool at height \(h \lt 12\) is the volume of the triangular cross sectional area of height \(h\) (as shown in the figure below) times the width (25 feet) of the pool. The height of the triangular cross section is \(h\) and the length is distance of the dotted line indicated in the figure.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:17.5%;margin-right:17.5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/3_5_Ez2Soln.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>Placing the cross section on a coordinate system as in the figure, the hypotenuse of the triangle is the line connecting the points \((0,-15)\) and \((60, -3)\text{.}\) This line has slope \(\frac{12}{60} = 0.2\) and \(y\)-intercept \((0,-15)\text{.}\) So the equation of this line is \(y = 0.2x-15\text{.}\) It is the \(x\) coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the \(y\)-coordinate \(h-15\) that is the length of the triangle whose height is \(h\text{.}\) So the length \(l\) is \(l = \frac{(h-15)+15}{0.2} = 5h\text{.}\) Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height \(h\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V = \left(\frac{1}{2}(h)(5h)\right)(25) = 62.5h^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Both \(V\) and \(h\) are functions of time. Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to  \(t\) gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = 62.5(2h) \frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{125h} \frac{dV}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>When the depth of water in the pool is \(5\) feet, then the depth is increasing at the rate</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{h = 5} = \frac{1}{125(5)} (800) = 1.28
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>feet per minute. Since \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is inversely proportional to \(h\text{,}\) the rate at which the depth of the water increases slows as \(h\) increases, so the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-3-5-rel-rates.html#solution-158">in-context</a></span>
