<p>Say that an investor is regularly purchasing stock in a particular company. Let \(N(t)\) represent the number of shares owned on day \(t\text{,}\) where \(t = 0\) represents the first day on which shares were purchased. Let \(S(t)\) give the value of one share of the stock on day \(t\text{;}\) note that the units on \(S(t)\) are dollars per share. To compute the total value of the stock on day \(t\text{,}\) we take the product</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V(t) = N(t) \, \text{shares}  \cdot S(t) \, \text{dollars per share}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Observe that over time, both the number of shares and the value of a given share will vary. The derivative \(N'(t)\) measures the rate at which the number of shares is changing, while \(S'(t)\) measures the rate at which the value per share is changing. How do these respective rates of change affect the rate of change of the total value function?</p>
