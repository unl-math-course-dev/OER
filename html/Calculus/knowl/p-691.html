<li><p>\(F'(t)\) has units measured in degrees Fahrenheit per minute.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Using a central difference,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
F''(30) \approx \frac{F'(45)-F'(15)}{30} = \frac{2.45-6.03}{30} \approx -0.119\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>The value \(F''(30) \approx -0.119\text{,}\) which is measured in degrees per minute per minute tells us, along with the other data, that at the moment \(t = 30\text{,}\) the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees, that its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute, and that the rate at which the temperature is rising is <em class="emphasis">falling</em> at a rate of -0.119 degrees per minute per minute. That is, while the temperature is rising, it is rising at a slower and slower rate. At \(t = 31\text{,}\) we'd expect that the rate of increase of the potato's temperature would have dropped to about 3.73 degrees per minute.</p></li>
<li><p>The potato's temperature increasing at a decreasing rate because the values of the first derivative of \(F\) are falling. Equivalently, this is because the value of \(F''(t)\) is negative throughout the given time interval.</p></li>
