<p>Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles. Because of the circle's symmetry, for each \(x\) value strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter, there are two corresponding \(y\)-values. For instance, in <a knowl="./knowl/F-2-7-Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F-2-7-Intro" alt="Figure 2.37 " title="Figure 2.37 ">Figure 2.37</a>, we have labeled \(A = (-3,\sqrt{7})\) and \(B = (-3,-\sqrt{7})\text{,}\) and these points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test. Hence, it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form \(y = f(x)\text{.}\) But portions of the circle can be represented explicitly as a function of \(x\text{,}\) such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of <a knowl="./knowl/F-2-7-Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F-2-7-Intro" alt="Figure 2.37 " title="Figure 2.37 ">Figure 2.37</a>. Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear, so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point. Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) at any point on the circle, even though we cannot write \(y\) explicitly as a function of \(x\text{.}\)</p>
