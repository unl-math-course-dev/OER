<li><p>A function \(f\) has limit \(L\) as \(x \to a\) if and only if \(f\) has a left-hand limit at \(x = a\text{,}\) \(f\) has a right-hand limit at \(x = a\text{,}\) and the left- and right-hand limits are equal. Visually, this means that there can be a hole in the graph at \(x = a\text{,}\) but the function must approach the same single value from either side of \(x = a\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>A function \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\) whenever \(f(a)\) is defined, \(f\) has a limit as \(x \to a\text{,}\) and the value of the limit and the value of the function agree. This guarantees that there is not a hole or jump in the graph of \(f\) at \(x = a\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>A function \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\) whenever \(f'(a)\) exists, which means that \(f\) has a tangent line at \((a,f(a))\) and thus \(f\) is locally linear at \(x = a\text{.}\) Informally, this means that the function looks like a line when viewed up close at \((a,f(a))\) and that there is not a corner point or cusp at \((a,f(a))\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Of the three conditions discussed in this section (having a limit at \(x = a\text{,}\) being continuous at \(x = a\text{,}\) and being differentiable at \(x = a\)), the strongest condition is being differentiable, and the next strongest is being continuous. In particular, if \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\text{,}\) then \(f\) is also continuous at \(x = a\text{,}\) and if \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\text{,}\) then \(f\) has a limit at \(x = a\text{.}\)</p></li>
