<p>Exploring the context of position, velocity, and acceleration is an excellent way to understand how a function, its first derivative, and its second derivative are related to one another. In <a knowl="./knowl/act-1-6-1.html" knowl-id="xref-act-1-6-1" alt="Activity 1.20 " title="Activity 1.20 ">ActivityÂ 1.20</a>, we can replace \(s\text{,}\) \(v\text{,}\) and \(a\) with an arbitrary function \(f\) and its derivatives \(f'\) and \(f''\text{,}\) and essentially all the same observations hold. In particular, note that the following are equivalent: on an interval where the graph of \(f\) is concave up, \(f'\) is increasing and \(f''\) is positive. Likewise, on an interval where the graph of \(f\) is concave down, \(f'\) is decreasing and \(f''\) is negative.</p>
