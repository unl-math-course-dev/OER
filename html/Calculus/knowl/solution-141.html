<li><p>The fact that \(f'(x) \leq 0\) for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\) means that \(f\) cannot increase in this interval. So either \(f\) is constant or \(f\) decreases somewhere in this interval. We can conclude that the global maximum value of \(f\) occurs at \(x=a\) and the global minimum value at \(x=b\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The information we are given shows that \(g\) is increasing on \((a,c)\) and decreasing on \((c,b)\text{.}\) So \(g\) has a global maximum value at \(x=c\text{.}\) We know that \(g\) must have a global minimum at either \(x=a\) or \(x=b\text{.}\) The information given does not tell us how much \(g\) increases on \((a,c)\) and decreases on \((c,b)\text{,}\) so we cannot determine the endpoint at which \(g\) attains its global minimum value.</p></li>
<li><p>In order for \(h(a)=h(b)\) and \(h''(x) \lt 0\) for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\text{,}\) the graph of \(h\) must look something like a parabola that opens down on the interval \([a,b]\text{.}\) Consequently, \(h\) has its global minimum at \(x=a\) and \(x=b\text{,}\) and its global maximum somewhere in \((a,b)\text{,}\) but we do not know the exact point at which \(h\) attains its global maximum.</p></li>
<li><p>The given information forces the graph of \(p\) to decrease on \((a,c)\) then increase on \((c,b)\text{.}\) Thus, we must have \(p(c) \lt p(b)\) and so \(p\) has its global minimum value at \(x=c\text{.}\) Since \(p(a) \gt p(b)\text{,}\) this makes \(p(a)\) the global maximum value of \(p\) on \([a,b]\text{.}\)</p></li>
