<p>As we work with the algebraic structure of functions, it is important to develop a big picture view of what we are doing. Here, we make several general observations based on the rules we have so far. </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The derivative of any polynomial function will be another polynomial function, and that the degree of the derivative is one less than the degree of the original function. For instance, if \(p(t) = 7t^5 - 4t^3 + 8t\text{,}\) \(p\) is a degree 5 polynomial, and its derivative, \(p'(t) = 35t^4 - 12t^2 + 8\text{,}\) is a degree 4 polynomial.</li>
<li>The derivative of any exponential function is another exponential function: for example, if \(g(z) = 7 \cdot 2^z\text{,}\) then \(g'(z) = 7 \cdot 2^z \ln(2)\text{,}\) which is also exponential.</li>
<li>We should not lose sight of the fact that all of the meaning of the derivative that we developed in <a href="C-1.html" class="xref" alt="Chapter 1 Understanding the Derivative" title="Chapter 1 Understanding the Derivative">ChapterÂ 1</a> still holds. The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the original function, as well as the slope of the tangent line at any selected point on the curve.</li>
