<p>In addition to our usual \(f'\) notation, there are other ways to denote the derivative of a function, as well as the instruction to take the derivative. If we are thinking about the relationship between \(y\) and \(x\text{,}\) we sometimes denote the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) by the symbol</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which we read “dee-y dee-x.” For example, if \(y = x^2\text{,}\) we'll write that the derivative is \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x\text{.}\) This notation comes from the fact that the derivative is related to the slope of a line, and slope is measured by \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\text{.}\) Note that while we read \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) as “change in \(y\) over change in \(x\text{,}\)” we view \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) as a single symbol, not a quotient of two quantities.</p>
