<p>If \(\frac{2}{k^2} \gt 1\text{,}\) then the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solution. Hence, whenever \(k^2 \lt 2\text{,}\) or \(k \lt \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\text{,}\) it follows that the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solutions \(x\text{,}\) which means that \(h''(x)\) is never zero (indeed, for these \(k\)-values, \(h''(x)\) is always positive so that \(h\) is always concave up). On the other hand, if \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\text{,}\) then \(\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1\text{,}\) which guarantees that \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has infinitely many solutions, due to the periodicity of the cosine function. At each such point, \(h''(x) = 2 - k^2 \cos(kx)\) changes sign, and therefore \(h\) has infinitely many inflection points whenever \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</p>
