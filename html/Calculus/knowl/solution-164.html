<p>The velocity function of the biker tells us that for the first hour, the biker pedals north at a velocity of \(11\) miles per hour. At the \(1\)-hour mark, the biker abruptly changes direction and then pedals south at \(10\) miles per hour for the next two hours; finally, at the \(3\)-hour mark, the biker again changes direction and then pedals north at \(9\) mph for the last hour of their trip.</p>
<p>Thus, the biker traveled \(11\) miles north from their starting point (mile \(1\)) and thus made the turn at \(t = 1\) at mile \(12\text{.}\) Two hours later, having pedaled south at \(10\) mph, they'd traveled \(20\) miles south, and thus were at mile \(12 - 20 = -8\) relative to Pigeon Lake. Finally, after biking at \(9\) mph north for the lat hour, they were back at mile \(-8 + 9 = 1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The furthest north the biker was occurred at time \(t = 1\text{.}\) This occurs because it is the only time when the derivative of the biker's position function changes from positive to negative, and thus \(s\) has a local maximum. In addition, we can see this based on our discussion above of how far the biker traveled in each direction on the various time intervals, and that the biker was \(12\) miles north of the lake at \(t = 1\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cyclist's total change in position is \(s(4) - s(0) = 0\text{.}\) In part (a), we established that \(s(1) = 12\text{,}\) \(s(3) = -8\text{,}\) and \(s(4) = 1\text{.}\) We were given that \(s(0) = 1\text{.}\) Thus, \(s(4) - s(0) = 0\text{,}\) and the biker ended up back where they started the trip.</p></li>
<li><p>The cyclist first traveled \(11\) miles north, then \(20\) miles south, and finally \(9\) miles north. Since \(11 + 20 + 9 = 40\text{,}\) their total distance traveled is \(40\) miles, even though their change of position \(0\text{,}\) as established in (b).</p></li>
<li>
<p>In the following figure, we see an approximate plot of the biker's position function. Since their velocity is constant on the various intervals, their position function is linear on those intervals with slope that matches the velocity. In addition, as pictured, the position function passes through the points we've established above like \((3,-8)\text{.}\)</p>
