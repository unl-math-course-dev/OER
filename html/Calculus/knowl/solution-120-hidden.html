<li><p>Since \(g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}\text{,}\) we see that \(g'(x) = 0\) implies that \(x = -4\) or \(x = 1\text{.}\) While \(x = 2\) makes \(g'\) undefined, we are told that \(g\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 2\text{,}\) so \(x = 2\) is not in the domain of \(g\text{,}\) and hence is technically not a critical number of \(g\text{.}\) Nonetheless, we place \(x = 2\) on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which \(g'\) may change sign.</p></li>
<li><p>The first derivative sign chart shows that \(g'(x) \gt 0\) for \(x \lt -4\text{,}\) \(g'(x) \lt 0\) for \(-4 \lt x \lt 1\text{,}\) \(g'(x) \lt 0\) for \(1 \lt x \lt 2\text{,}\) and \(g'(x) \gt 0\) for \(x \gt 2\text{.}\) By the first derivative test, \(g\) has a local maximum at \(x = -4\) and neither a max nor min at \(x = 1\text{.}\) As these are the only two critical numbers, these are the only two locations for possible extremes. (Note: although \(g\) changes from decreasing to increasing at \(x = 2\text{,}\) this is due to a vertical asymptote, and \(g\) does not have a minimum there.)</p></li>
<li><p>Because \(g\) is decreasing as \(x \to 2^-\) (where \(g\) has a vertical asymptote), \(g\) does not have a global minimum. For \(x \gt 2\text{,}\) \(g\) is always increasing, which suggests that \(g\) does not have a global maximum (though we do not know for sure that \(g\) increases without bound).</p></li>
<li>
<p>We observe that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} g'(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 4}{x-2} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x}}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2 + 2x - 7 + \frac{4}{x}}{1 - \frac{2}{x}}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \infty
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Since \(g'(x) \to \infty\) as \(x \to \infty\text{,}\) this tells us that \(g\) increases without bound as \(x \to \infty\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From all of our work above, we know that \(g\) has a local maximum at \(x = -4\text{,}\) a horizontal tangent line with neither a max nor min at \(x = 1\text{,}\) and a vertical asymptote at \(x = 2\text{,}\) plus \(g\) and \(g'\) both increase without bound as \(x \to \infty\text{.}\) Thus, a possible graph of \(g\) is the following.</p>
