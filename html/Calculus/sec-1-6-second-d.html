<p id="p-605">Given a function \(f(x)\) defined on the interval \((a,b)\text{,}\) we say that <dfn class="terminology">\(f\) is increasing on \((a,b)\)</dfn> provided that for all \(x\text{,}\) \(y\) in the interval \((a,b)\text{,}\) if \(x \lt y\text{,}\) then \(f(x) \lt f(y)\text{.}\) Similarly, we say that <dfn class="terminology">\(f\) is decreasing on \((a,b)\)</dfn> provided that for all \(x\text{,}\) \(y\) in the interval \((a,b)\text{,}\) if \(x \lt y\text{,}\) then \(f(x) \gt f(y)\text{.}\)</p></article><p id="p-606">Simply put, an increasing function is one that is rising as we move from left to right along the graph, and a decreasing function is one that falls as the value of the input increases. If the function has a derivative, the sign of the derivative tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing.</p>
<p id="p-607">Let \(f\) be a function that is differentiable on an interval \((a,b)\text{.}\) It is possible to show that that \(f\) is increasing on \((a,b)\) if and only if \(f'(x) &gt; 0\) for every \(x\) such that \(a \lt x \lt b\text{;}\) similarly, \(f\) is decreasing on \((a,b)\) if and only if \(f'(x) \lt 0\text{.}\) If \(f'(a) = 0\text{,}\) then \(f\) is neither increasing nor decreasing at \(x = a\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-608">For example, the function pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-Intro2.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-Intro2" alt="Figure 1.49 " title="Figure 1.49 ">Figure1.49</a> is increasing on the entire interval \(-2 \lt x \lt 0\text{.}\) Note that at both \(x = \pm 2\) and \(x = 0\text{,}\) we say that \(f\) is neither increasing nor decreasing, because \(f'(x) = 0\) at these values.</p>

</div>
<p id="p-610">Because \(f'\) is itself a function, it is perfectly feasible for us to consider the derivative of the derivative, which is the new function \(y = [f'(x)]'\text{.}\) We call this resulting function <em class="emphasis">the second derivative</em>  of \(y = f(x)\text{,}\) and denote the second derivative by \(y = f''(x)\text{.}\) Consequently, we will sometimes call \(f'\) the first derivative of \(f\text{,}\) rather than simply the derivative of \(f\text{.}\)</p>

</h3>
<p id="p-613">In addition to asking <em class="emphasis">whether</em> a function is increasing or decreasing, it is also natural to inquire <em class="emphasis">how</em> a function is increasing or decreasing. There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-3optsi.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-3optsi" alt="Figure 1.51 " title="Figure 1.51 ">Figure1.51</a>: the function can increase more and more rapidly, it can increase at the same rate, or it can increase in a way that is slowing down. Fundamentally, we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends, with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all. More than this, we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="F-1-6-3optsi"><img src="images/1_6_3optsi.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">1.51</span>Three functions that are all increasing, but doing so at an increasing rate, at a constant rate, and at a decreasing rate, respectively.</figcaption></figure><p id="p-614">On the leftmost curve in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-3optsi.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-3optsi" alt="Figure 1.51 " title="Figure 1.51 ">Figure1.51</a>, draw a sequence of tangent lines to the curve. As we move from left to right, the slopes of those tangent lines will increase. Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing, and this explains why we say this function is <em class="emphasis">increasing at an increasing rate</em>. For the rightmost graph in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-3optsi.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-3optsi" alt="Figure 1.51 " title="Figure 1.51 ">Figure1.51</a>, observe that as \(x\) increases, the function increases, but the slopes of the tangent lines decrease. This function is <em class="emphasis">increasing at a decreasing rate</em>.</p>
<p id="p-615">Similar options hold for how a function can decrease. Here we must be extra careful with our language, because decreasing functions involve negative slopes. Negative numbers present an interesting tension between common language and mathematical language. For example, it can be tempting to say that \(-100\) is bigger than \(-2\text{.}\) But we must remember that greater than describes how numbers lie on a number line: \(x \gt y\) provided that \(x\) lies to the right of \(y\text{.}\) So of course, \(-100\) is less than \(-2\text{.}\) Informally, it might be helpful to say that \(-100\) is more negative than \(-2\text{.}\) When a function's values are negative, and those values get more negative as the input increases, the function must be decreasing.</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="F-1-6-3optsd"><img src="images/1_6_3optsd.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">1.52</span>From left to right, three functions that are all decreasing, but doing so in different ways.</figcaption></figure><p id="p-616">Now consider the three graphs shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-3optsd.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-3optsd" alt="Figure 1.52 " title="Figure 1.52 ">Figure1.52</a>. Clearly the middle graph depicts a function decreasing at a constant rate. Now, on the first curve, draw a sequence of tangent lines. We see that the slopes of these lines get less and less negative as we move from left to right. That means that the values of the first derivative, while all negative, are increasing, and thus we say that the leftmost curve is <em class="emphasis">decreasing at an increasing rate</em>.</p>
<p id="p-617">This leaves only the rightmost curve in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-3optsd.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-3optsd" alt="Figure 1.52 " title="Figure 1.52 ">Figure1.52</a> to consider. For that function, the slopes of the tangent lines are negative throughout the pictured interval, but as we move from left to right, the slopes get more and more negative. Hence the slope of the curve is decreasing, and we say that the function is <em class="emphasis">decreasing at a decreasing rate</em>.</p>
<p id="p-618">We now introduce the notion of <em class="emphasis">concavity</em>  which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors. When a curve opens upward on a given interval, like the parabola \(y = x^2\) or the exponential growth function \(y = e^x\text{,}\) we say that the curve is <em class="emphasis">concave up</em> on that interval. Likewise, when a curve opens down, like the parabola \(y = -x^2\) or the opposite of the exponential function \(y = -e^{x}\text{,}\) we say that the function is <em class="emphasis">concave down</em>. Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.</p>
<p id="p-619">In <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-concavity.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-concavity" alt="Figure 1.53 " title="Figure 1.53 ">Figure1.53</a>, we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each. On the lefthand plot, where the function is concave up, observe that the tangent lines always lie below the curve itself, and the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing as we move from left to right. In other words, the function \(f\) is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative, \(f'\text{,}\) is increasing on that interval. Similarly, on the righthand plot in <a knowl="./knowl/F-1-6-concavity.html" knowl-id="xref-F-1-6-concavity" alt="Figure 1.53 " title="Figure 1.53 ">Figure1.53</a>, where the function shown is concave down, we see that the tangent lines alway lie above the curve, and the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right. The fact that its derivative, \(f'\text{,}\) is decreasing makes \(f\) concave down on the interval.</p>

<li id="li-574"><p id="p-703">A differentiable function \(f\) is increasing at a point or on an interval whenever its first derivative is positive, and decreasing whenever its first derivative is negative.</p></li>
<li id="li-575"><p id="p-704">By taking the derivative of the derivative of a function \(f\text{,}\) we arrive at the second derivative, \(f''\text{.}\) The second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the first derivative. The sign of the second derivative tells us whether the slope of the tangent line to \(f\) is increasing or decreasing.</p></li>
<li id="li-576"><p id="p-705">A differentiable function is concave up whenever its first derivative is increasing (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is positive), and concave down whenever its first derivative is decreasing (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is negative). Examples of functions that are everywhere concave up are \(y = x^2\) and \(y = e^x\text{;}\) examples of functions that are everywhere concave down are \(y = -x^2\) and \(y = -e^x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-577"><p id="p-706">The units on the second derivative are units of output per unit of input per unit of input. They tell us how the value of the derivative function is changing in response to changes in the input. In other words, the second derivative tells us the rate of change of the rate of change of the original function.</p></li>
