<p>In the Middle Ages in Europe, castles were built as defensive strongholds. An attacking force would build a huge catapult called a trebuchet to hurl rocks and scrap metal inside the castle walls. The engineers could adjust its range by varying the mass of the projectiles. The mass, \(m\text{,}\) of the projectile should be inversely proportional to the square of the distance, \(d\text{,}\) to the target. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Use a negative exponent to write \(m\) as a function of \(d\text{,}\) \(m = f (d)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The engineers test the trebuchet with a \(20\)-kilogram projectile, which lands \(250\) meters away. Find the constant of proportionality; then rewrite your formula for \(m\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Graph \(m = f (d)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The trebuchet is \(180\) meters from the courtyard within the castle. What size projectile will hit the target?</p></li>
<li><p>The attacking force would like to hurl a \(100\)-kilogram projectile at the castle. How close must the attackers bring their trebuchet?</p></li>
